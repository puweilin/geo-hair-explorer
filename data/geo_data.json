Slow-cycling stem cells (label retaining cells, LRCs), fast-cycling stem cells (non-label retaining cells, nLRCs) express unique gene signatures in both skin and oral tissues and have independent stem cell identities. Our data indicates that there are similarities and differences in gene expression patterns between LRC and non-LRC populations in different epithelial tissues, suggesting stem cell autonomous heterogeneity and environmental differences.",

    "Summary": "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common human tumor and arises from keratinocytes that comprise the epidermis and its associated hair follicles. Remarkably, transformed keratinocytes within a cSCC retain some ability to execute the terminal differentiation program that typically generates a stratified epidermis. Instead of the polarized stratification towards the body surface seen in normal epidermis, cSCC keratinocytes differentiate concentrically inward to produce keratin pearls. It is well appreciated that cSCC differentiation status is correlated with degree of local invasion and potential for distant metastasis, with well differentiated tumors having a better prognosis. While molecular mechanisms that govern the differentiation process are incompletely understood, identifying candidate molecules associated with cSCC differentiation can provide new histologic markers for prognostic stratification. Here we demonstrate that Flower (FWE), a newly described regulator of lamellar body (LB) trafficking in normal epidermis, is specifically expressed within highly differentiated layers of cSCC. Genetic knockout of the hFWE gene dysregulates cornification and LB-related gene expression leading to abnormal keratinization patterns, while ectopic hFWE4 expression drives G1-arrest and exit from the proliferative basal keratinocyte population. Additionally, we find that poorly differentiated keratinocyte regions of human cSCC exhibit minimal FWE-positivity, while this population is readily detectable in well-differentiated regions. We propose that FWE represents a novel differentiation marker in cSCC that could be utilized for classifying differentiation status and prognostic stratifying these tumors.",

    "Summary": "Signaling interactions between the dermal papilla (DP) and neighboring stem cells in the hair germ (HGSCs) and bulge (BuSCs) regulate new follicle growth in the hair cycle. To study these interactions, the three populations had been profiled together by now-outdated microarrays or separately by bulk RNA-sequencing. Recent single-cell transcriptomics established signatures of DP, BuSCs and HGSCs, but low detection sensitivity limited the depth of gene expression discovery. Here, we define the transcriptomes of DP, BuSCs, HGSCs, epidermal, follicle and dermal fibroblast cells – after flow-sorting each population from four neighboring mouse back skin regions – to gain deeper insights into the unique gene expression programs of SCs and their instructive niche. With cross-comparisons of 56 whole-transcriptome measurements, we classify cell type-specific molecular signatures of enriched genes with unprecedented sensitivity. Joint analysis with signatures from 15 leading studies published in the last 20 years revealed many previously undescribed DP, BuSC and HGSC genes in mouse and human counterparts. With ligand-receptor mapping and CellChat analyses we then uncover comprehensive cell-cell communication insights. Finally, we provide a new installment of our Hair-Gel repository along with numerous signature and other gene tables for easy exploration of gene expression in hair follicle SCs and their niche.",

    "Summary": "The loss of fur during human evolution has long mystified scientists and the public. Reduced hair density coincides with the acquisition of epidermal rete ridges, whose developmental timing and molecular mechanisms are poorly understood despite their prominence in humans. Examination of human and pig skin development revealed that rete ridges form through an independent mechanism from hair follicles and sweat glands by establishing interconnected epidermal invaginations. We documented rete ridge occurrence across Mammalia, including in grizzly bears and dolphins, and showed that neonatal pig wounds can regenerate them de novo. Multi-species spatiotemporal transcriptomics identified significant signaling interactions between epidermal and dermal cells during rete ridge morphogenesis, particularly through BMP. We also demonstrated that murine fingerpad skin forms rete ridges and functionally requires epidermal BMP signaling. We propose that evolution of rete ridges in mammalian skin involved replacement of the molecular program for formation of discrete microscopic appendages, including hair follicles and sweat glands, with a distinct program for the interconnected appendage network. Broad epidermal activation of BMP is required for the development of rete ridge networks organized around underlying dermal pockets. Understanding rete ridge mechanisms may enable the development of therapeutic approaches to regenerate epidermal appendages lost during wounding or disease in humans.",

    "Summary": "Macrophages and monocytes are essential components of the immune system that distinguish themselves from all other cells in the body by expressing a beta isoform of the folate receptor (FRβ). Because FRβ does not bind folate until the macrophage/monocyte is exposed to immunosuppressive cytokines, the question naturally arose whether FRβ might perform an immune-related function. We report here that FRβ knockout mice display autoimmune symptoms that can include alopecia, enlarged spleens, and dermatitis. We further show that bone marrow-derived macrophages from KO mice exhibit strong upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and downregulation of anti-inflammatory genes. Exogenous inflammatory stimuli are also more intense in FRβ KO mice, and syngeneic tumors (TRAMP C2, MC38) grow much slower in FRβ-depleted mice. Analysis of these tumors further reveals that CD69+ T-cell populations are increased while PD1+ T-cells, PD-L1+ TAMs and PD-L1+ MDSCs are decreased in the malignant lesions. Because FRβ deletion or blockade of FRβ with a monoclonal antibody impairs a macrophages' ability to suppress T-cell activation, and since FRβ expression correlates inversely with human cancer patient survival, we conclude that FRβ performs a checkpoint function specifically in macrophages and MDSCs.",

    "Summary": "Stress profoundly affects health, but the mechanisms driving stress-induced tissue changes remain poorly understood. Here, we show that strong acute stress drives rapid hair loss and initiates autoimmunity. Under stress, hyperactivated sympathetic nerves release excessive norepinephrine, causing necrosis in rapidly dividing hair follicle transit-amplifying cells (HF-TACs) while sparing most hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). This differential sensitivity to stress stems from differences in cell death genes, metabolic strategies, and calcium homeostasis. Together, these factors render HF-TACs more vulnerable to the sudden calcium surges triggered by norepinephrine. HF-TAC necrosis releases cellular debris that triggers macrophage clearance and dendritic cell activation, ultimately leading to the activation and amplification of autoreactive T cells that can attack the hair follicle. Our findings reveal mechanistically how stress causes immediate tissue damage in the highly proliferative HF-TACs via sympathetic nerve-induced necrosis, which in turn fuels the activation of a T cell-mediated response against the hair follicle.",

External irritation has long been observed in humans to cause acquired hypertrichosis, but the mechanism is unknown. We discovered that external irritation activates hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), leading to substantial hair regeneration in mice. The external irritation is sensed by niche adipocytes, which undergo lipolysis to activate HFSCs, rather than by the HFSCs themselves. Fatty acids released by adipocytes are taken up by HFSCs and activate them by priming them for fatty acid oxidation and increasing the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation capacity for ATP production. Inhibiting lipolysis, fatty acid uptake, or fatty acid oxidation restricts irritation-induced hair regeneration. As a result, adipocytes create an injury-sensing niche, allowing HFSCs to respond to external irritation by initiating a new round of hair growth to protect the skin.",

    "Summary": "While this is available for murine HFs, systematic characterization of the transcriptome of specific human hair follicle (HF) compartments remains a major unmet challenge in human hair research. Here, we have aimed to initiate the generation of such an atlas to reveal HF compartment-specific transcriptome. We performed laser capture microdissection (LCM) on 8 selected compartments, i.e. bulge outer root sheath (ORS), suprabulbar ORS, inner root sheath (IRS), precortical hair matrix (HM), germinative HM, dermal papilla (DP), the lower dermal cup (DC), and the connective tissue sheath (CTS), of human anagen VI scalp HFs, and analysed these by RNA-seq. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to validate the distinctness of the microdissected compartments. Biological replicates were clearly separated by HF compartments and a high degree of similarity of the distinct transcriptional profiles of each examined compartment was seen. Afterwards, we matched well-known signature genes to the correct HF compartments. For example, VCAN (versican) and ALPL (alkaline phosphatase) were correctly expressed in the DP, the lower DC, and suprabulbar CTS, while TCHH (trichohyalin) was solely found in the proximal IRS, and KRT85 (Keratin 85) and KRT31 (Keratin 31) were almost exclusively expressed in the precortical HM. These transcriptomic data were used to generate an easily accessible database for identifying and defining compartment-specific gene expression profiles, which can be ultimately made publicly accessible (“hair follicle MONasterium InteraCtive atlas – hairMONic”). This human HF transcriptomic map and the associated interactive database will support the identification of HF compartment-specific signature genes, and facilitates the development of compartment-specific, therapeutic interventions for the management of human HF disorders.",

    "Summary": "Aging is a consequence of complex molecular changes, but the roles for individual microRNAs (miRNAs) in aging remain unclear. One of the few miRNAs that is upregulated during both normal and premature aging is miR-29. We confirmed this finding in our study in both mouse and monkey models. Follow-up analysis of the transcriptomic changes during normal aging revealed that miR-29 is among the top miRNAs predicted to drive the aging-related gene expression changes. We also showed that partial loss of miR-29 extends the lifespan of Zmpste-/- mice, an established model of progeria, which indicates that miR-29 is functionally important in this accelerated aging model. To examine whether miR-29 upregulation alone is sufficient to promote aging-related phenotypes in vivo, we generated mice in which miR-29 can be conditionally overexpressed (miR-29TG). We found that miR-29 overexpression in mice is sufficient to drive aging-related phenotypes including alopecia, kyphosis, osteoporosis and senescence, and leads to early lethality. Transcriptomic analysis of both young miR-29TG and old WT mice revealed shared downregulation of genes enriched in extracellular matrix and fatty acid metabolism, and shared upregulation of genes in pathways linked to inflammation. Together, these results highlight the functional importance of miR-29 in controlling a gene expression program that drives aging-related phenotypes.",

    "Summary": "Ulcerative dermatitis (UD) in mice is an idiopathic skin disease characterized by intense pruritus, hair loss, self-inflicted lesions, and progression to ulceration. UD serves as a model for chronic skin inflammation and non-healing wounds in humans, as it shares key pathological features with these conditions. C57BL/6 mice are particularly susceptible to UD, making this strain a valuable model for studying the mechanisms underlying skin injury and inflammation. In previous studies, Has2 transgenic mice exhibited a higher incidence of UD compared with wild-type controls, implicating elevated hyaluronan synthesis in disease susceptibility. To investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms, we induced scratching-triggered UD in Has2 overexpressing (Has2OE) and wild-type mice (n = 4 per group) and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on lesional skin to compare cell-type composition and gene expression changes.",

Lastly, we identify that the inhibitory FGF signaling produced by the hair follicle niche keratinocytes maintains H2AK119ub in quiescent HFSCs.

    "Summary": "Tightly regulated cell-cell and cell-niche intercommunications via intertwined signaling networks are involved in maintaining normal hair follicle (HF) homeostasis, cycling and cell fate determination. However, knowledge of specific mechanisms by which hair loss takes place under pathological situations is needed. Using a keratinocyte-specific knockout mouse model, we uncover that the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) signaling node plays a key role in HF homeostasis. Epidermal GRK2 ablation causes alterations during anagen induction, giving rise to abnormal cyst-like structures. HF-linked cysts display aberrant growth and differentiation patterns as well as lineage infidelity, displaying features of abortive HFs unable to fully acquire canonical hallmarks. Cysts triggered by GRK2 deletion displace the dermal papilla away from the bulge and promote irreversible changes in HF stem cell architecture, leading to bulge destruction and hair loss. Our data provide unforeseen roles of GRK2 in epidermal physiology and uncover mechanisms linking dystrophic follicular cysts formation with hair loss, with potential connections to pathogenic processes operating in immune-mediated alopecias.",

We found devastating necrotic changes in the dermal and epidermal tissues at post-operated day 3, (POD3), followed by significant regeneration processes of the follicular and interfollicular tissues after POD 6. Dermal papilla cells in the necrotic milieu exserted significant activation of Wnt signaling pathway and Sox2 and Fgf7 expressions, all of those are critical for follicular development in the fetal skin. We further identified a unique mesenchymal subpopulation, which expressed keratinocyte-specific genes, such as Krt5 and Epcam, as well as Irf6, a transcriptional factor to induce mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). Our data revealed significant contribution of the unique mesenchymal cell populations for the follicular and interfollicular epithelial regeneration after severe necrosis in the skin graft.",

    "Summary": "Tissue formation requires a coordinated balance of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Posttranslational protein modifications have emerged as a mechanism utilized to regulate progenitor cell state transitions. Herein, we exploit the well characterized and stereotyped hair follicle development to delineate the function of PADI4; an enzyme converting peptidylarginine to citrulline. Single cell-sequencing places Padi4 in both progenitor and differentiated hair lineage cells during hair follicle development. We show that the absence of PADI4 induces gene expression across hair follicle cell clusters, suggesting that PADI4 acts to negatively impact transcription. In addition, we establish PADI4 as a negative regulator of proliferation, acting of LEF1-positive hair shaft committed progenitor cells. Mechanistically, PADI4 citrullinates proteins associated with mRNA-processing and ribosomal biogenesis, and lack of PADI4 promotes protein synthesis and rRNA transcription in vivo, in both hair follicle progenitor and committed lineage cells. Characterizing key translational effectors, we demonstrate that PADI4 interacts with 4E-BP1 and reveal a crosstalk between PADI4 activity and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. We report that PADI4 contributes to hair follicle development by repressing progenitor cell proliferation and translational activity. This work sheds new light on how posttranslational modifications impact progenitor cell states and tissue formation.",

    "Summary": "The incidence of diseases, including cancer, increases with age. While age-associated diseases with stem cell exhaustion are potentially antagonistic to cancer development1, the relationship between those is still largely unknown. Here, we report that melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) and their niche coordinately govern the antagonism between poliosis (hair graying) and melanoma. We found that McSCs undergo senescence-associated differentiation (seno-differentiation) in response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) such as by ionizing radiation (IR) and ageing upon their activation for self-renewal, leading to their depletion and resultant hair graying at the cost of cancer protection. RNA-seq and functional analysis of the skin exposed to different types of genotoxic stress revealed that activation of the p53-p21 axis and TBK1 pathway by DSBs within McSCs causes their depletion. Comparative analysis of the young vs. aged stem cell niche identified the KIT ligand (KITL/SCF) as a master niche factor for McSC self-renewal. Strikingly, co-exposure of the irradiated skin to carcinogens rescued hair graying by augmenting the secretory phenotype of niche cells to repress McSC seno-differentiation through the dual activation of KIT signaling and arachidonic acid pathway in McSCs. Collectively, our data provide concrete evidence for the phenotypic trade-off between ageing and cancer based on the niche.",

    "Summary": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a severe skin disorder affecting 1% of the global population. Its pathogenesis is multifactorial and poorly understood, involving aberrant keratinization and autoinflammation. Whether autoinflammatory events precede or follow hyperkeratotic changes in hair follicle (HF) epithelia is unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), we defined the cellular composition of HF cells, the primary cells involved in HS, and confirmed these findings in the Fol-HYDRA cohort. We identified three main cell families: i) HF matrix lineage enriched for MSX2, ii) non-matrix lineage enriched for KRT14, and iii) immune cells enriched for PTPRC. Unsupervised clustering of HF cells from controls and HS patients revealed significant differences in non-matrix cells, segregating patients into two groups. Group one is enriched in cluster 1 (IBL), while group two is enriched in cluster 0 (mORS), each displaying distinct transcriptomic changes. Gene set enrichment analysis showed IBLs enriched for keratinization genes and mORS for interferon response genes. Trajectory analysis revealed HF stem cells differentiating into either IBL or mORS pathways. Confirmed in 49 HS patients, these pathways correspond to different clinical phenotypes. Our findings provide a novel perspective on HS pathology, identifying two key pathways: one in keratinization and the other in inflammation. These pathways define different endotypes for HS patients, suggesting potential markers for personalized medicine.",

We find that androgen receptor-positive dermal fibroblasts are the principal source of CXCL12, which acts in an autocrine manner via ACKR3 to drive TGF-β–mediated extracellular matrix deposition. In parallel, CXCL12 signals through CXCR4 to reprogram a Sox2+ Twist1+ dermal papilla cell population toward a fibrotic, low-inductive state and expand a pro-fibrotic Trem2+ macrophage subset. Blockade of CXCL12 reverses these transcriptional and cellular alterations across stromal, follicular, and immune compartments, restoring a regenerative skin niche and supporting hair regrowth. These findings position CXCL12 as a central mediator of fibroimmune remodeling in AGA and establish its neutralization as a promising therapeutic strategy.",
    "Overall_Design": "Skin samples were collected from three groups of mice: control (Con), androgenetic alopecia (AGA) model induced by testosterone propionate (TP), and TP-induced AGA model treated with a CXCL12-neutralizing antibody (TP+Ab). At the end of the treatment period, dorsal skin tissues were harvested (n = 15 per group) and enzymatically dissociated to generate single-cell suspensions for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq).",

    "Summary": "Ectodermal appendage formation requires hedgehog (HH) signal reception, its conduction through the primary cilium and activation of Gli transcription factors (TF). How HH signalling induces cell-type-specific responses through Gli TF in stem cells (SCs) and their ciliadependence remain open questions. Here, we use conditional mouse mutants to genetically dissect the roles of Gli and cilia HH mediators in the skin epithelium. Upon Gli2 depletion, hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis is delayed whereas sebaceous gland (SG) formation is enhanced, suggesting a dual role for Gli2 during appendage formation. By controlling proliferation of SG SCs, Gli2 impacts on the number and size of individual SG lobes. Whereas ablation of Gli3 shows no detectable phenotypes, HF cell fate is blocked in Gli2/3 double knockouts. In addition, loss of cilia phenocopies the loss of Gli2 but not the Gli2/3 mutants. Our study reveals that Gli3 exerts activator and cilia-independent functions in the absence of Gli2.",

    "Summary": "Alopecia is a highly prevalent hair loss disorder characterized by abnormality of hair cycling. Induction of autophagy and secretion of growth factors by adipocyte precursors are sufficient to activate quiescent hair follicles. Yet therapies targeting these processes remain limited. Here, we identify rebamipide, a drug initially intended for gastric ulcer treatment, as a promising candidate for hair regeneration by modulating dermal adipocyte metabolism. Topical rebamipide treatment induces autophagy and ATGL-mediated lipolysis in dermal adipocytes. Through primary culture systems, we demonstrate that rebamipide-driven lipolysis triggers adipocyte dedifferentiation, activating HFSCs via elevated PDGFα levels. Mechanistically, computer simulations and target validation experiments confirm that rebamipide directly binds to the prostaglandin E receptor EP4, triggering PI3K/ERK-dependent autophagy and lipolysis. Collectively, our findings highlight EP4 as a novel therapeutic target for alopecia and position rebamipide as an agent that couples lipid metabolism remodeling with HFSC activation.",

To investigate the role of MCL-1, a BCL-2 family protein with anti-apoptotic and non-apoptotic functions in this dynamic process, we delete Mcl-1 within the skin epithelium, using both constitutive and inducible systems. Mcl-1 deletion does not impair HF organogenesis but results in gradual hair loss and HF stem cells (HFSC) elimination. Single-cell RNA-seq profiling unveils activated DNA repair and P53 signaling pathways in HFSCs during hair regeneration. Acute Mcl-1 deletion led to the depletion of activated HFSCs. Moreover, the ERBB pathway is found to promote MCL-1 protein expression in HFs. Accordingly, ERBB inhibition depletes activated HFSCs in adult mice. Remarkably, the loss of a single Bak allele rescues Mcl-1 deletion-associated defects in both HFs and mammary glands. These findings emphasize the pivotal role of MCL-1 in inhibiting proliferation stress-induced apoptosis when quiescent stem cells re-enter cell cycling to fuel tissue regeneration.",

    "Summary": "Background: Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS-1) is a life-threatening, autosomal recessive syndrome caused by autoimmune regulator (AIRE) deficiency. In APS-1, self-reactive T cells escape thymic negative selection, infiltrate organs, and drive autoimmune injury. The effector mechanisms governing T-cell-mediated damage in APS-1 remain poorly understood. Methods: We examined whether APS-1 could be classified as a disease mediated by interferon-γ. We first assessed patients with APS-1 who were participating in a prospective natural history study and evaluated mRNA and protein expression in blood and tissues. We then examined the pathogenic role of interferon-γ using Aire-/-Ifng-/- mice and Aire-/- mice treated with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib. On the basis of our findings, we used ruxolitinib to treat five patients with APS-1 and assessed clinical, immunologic, histologic, transcriptional, and autoantibody responses. Results: Patients with APS-1 had enhanced interferon-γ responses in blood and in all examined autoimmunity-affected tissues. Aire-/- mice had selectively increased interferon-γ production by T cells and enhanced interferon-γ, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (pSTAT1), and CXCL9 signals in multiple organs. Ifng ablation or ruxolitinib-induced JAK-STAT blockade in Aire-/- mice normalized interferon-γ responses and averted T-cell infiltration and damage in organs. Ruxolitinib treatment of five patients with APS-1 led to decreased levels of T-cell-derived interferon-γ, normalized interferon-γ and CXCL9 levels, and remission of alopecia, oral candidiasis, nail dystrophy, gastritis, enteritis, arthritis, Sjögren's-like syndrome, urticaria, and thyroiditis. No serious adverse effects from ruxolitinib were identified in these patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that APS-1, which is caused by AIRE deficiency, is characterized by excessive, multiorgan interferon-γ-mediated responses. JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib in five patients showed promising results. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.).",

    "Summary": "Bioactive sphingolipids serve as an essential building block of membranes, forming a selective barrier ensuring subcellular compartmentalization and facilitating cell type-specific intercellular communication through regulation of the plasma membrane receptor repertoire. How the cell type-specific lipid compositions are achieved and what is their functional significance in tissue morphogenesis and maintenance has remained unclear. Here, we identify a stem-cell specific role for ceramide synthase 4 (CerS4) in orchestrating fate decisions in the skin epidermis. Deletion of CerS4 in the epidermis prevents the effective establishment of the adult hair follicle bulge stem cell (HFSCs) niche due to altered differentiation trajectories of HFSC precursors towards upper hair follicle and inner bulge fates. Mechanistically, the HFSC differentiation defects arise from a stem cell intrinsic imbalance of key ceramides and sphingolipids, and associated hyperactivity of canonical Wnt signaling. The lack of HFSCs leads to disruption of hair follicle architecture and hair follicle barrier function, ultimately triggering a Th2-dominated immune infiltration closely resembling human atopic dermatitis. This work uncovers a fundamental role for a cell state-specific sphingolipid profile in epidermal stem cell homeostasis and the role of an intact stem cell niche in maintaining an intact skin barrier.",

    "Summary": "It is widely recognized that the glycocalyx has significant implications in regulating the self-renewal and differentiation of adult stem cells. Yet, its composition remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the fucose-binding Aleuria aurantia lectin (AAL) binds differentially to basal cells in the stratified epithelium of the human limbus, hair follicle and meibomian gland duct. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting in combination with single-cell transcriptomics, we find that most epithelial progenitor cells and melanocytes in the limbus display low AAL staining (AALlow) on their cell surface, an attribute that is gradually lost in epithelial cells as they differentiate into mature corneal cells. AALlow epithelial cells were enriched in putative limbal stem cell markers and displayed high proliferative potential. Further analyses revealed that AALlow epithelial cells had reduced expression of GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase, an enzyme catalyzing the first and regulatory steps in the de novo biosynthesis of GDP-fucose, and that inhibition of fucosylation using a small-molecule fucose analogue stimulated the proliferative potential of limbal epithelial cells ex vivo. These results provide critical insights into the composition of the glycocalyx in adult stem cells and could thereby have implications to the regeneration of the human limbal stem cell niche.",

In an attempt to identify genes that contribute to the androgen-responsive phenotype, we performed a thorough transcriptome profiling of hair follicles (HFs) from frontal and occipital scalp, chin and armpit. Through this analysis, three specifiic different expressed genes(LGALS7B, FABP4, FOS) were identified using qPCR, immunofluorescence. The differences in the expression of these genes in cultured beard and frontal HF reflected less inflammation and immune response, more active keratinization and PPARs signaling in beard HFs compared to frontal HFs. This profiling results be used to understand the different molecular mechanism of hair growth between AGA beard and HF, and those provided a possibility for the enlarged beard phenotype and AGA treatment.",

It is also produced in response to stimulation of the skin (e.g., during hugging and massaging) and music therapy, among others. The effects of OXT on various organs have been revealed in recent years; however, the relationship between hair follicles and OXT remains unclear. In this study, we examined the effects of OXT on dermal papilla (DP) cells, that control hair growth by secreting growth/regression signals. Gene expression analysis revealed that DP functional markers were significantly upregulated in DP cells treated with OXT. In addition, we tested the hair growth-promoting effects of OXT using in vitro hair follicle organoids. OXT promoted the growth of hair peg-like sprouting by upregulating the expression of hair growth-promoting factors including genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA). This study highlights the positive effects of OXT in hair follicles and may assist in the development of new treatments for alopecia.",

    "Summary": "Aging is characterized by a gradual decline in function, partly due to molecular damage that accumulates over time. Human skin is highly susceptible to both chronological aging and environmental damage in the form of UV photoaging. This results in detrimental structural and physiological changes with age. In this study we sought to comprehensively address both chronological and photoaging at the single-cell level, and to explore genetic and environmental factors, revealing their influences on the aging process. We included samples from young, middle-aged, and old individuals, and with these samples, we compared chronological aging and photoaging. Utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing, we created a comprehensive human skin cell atlas, that offers insights into the cellular composition and functions. We investigated the renewal ability of epidermis stem cells as they age and extended the study to fibroblasts, hair follicles, and endothelial cells. Examining the genetic landscape of aging in keratinocytes, we identified two distinct \"gene modules\" with altered gene expression during aging. Furthermore, we uncovered that skin aging involves interactions between epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts, as well as extensive communication of keratinocytes with various other skin cell types as revealed through ligand-receptor pairs. Interactions, such as COL17A1-A1b1complex, highlighted a direct link between keratinocytes and fibroblast stimulation for collagen production. Most importantly, A key gene, MYO1, associated with skin aging was identified, leading to the development of an innovative mRNA treatment aimed at promoting skin rejuvenation by targeting this gene. Experimental results demonstrated that the mRNA treatment reduces basal stem cell senescence, increases basal stem cell proliferation, and enhances collagen production in fibroblasts via keratinocyte-fibroblast communication. The MYO1-targeted treatment is validated as an effective strategy for reversing skin aging by targeting cellular mechanisms.",

    "Summary": "Intermittent fasting has gained increasing popularity globally for its potential benefits for improving health and managing weight, but how it impacts the homeostasis and regeneration of peripheral tissues remains elusive. Here we report that in mice, commonly used intermittent fasting regimens negatively affect hair regeneration by selectively inducing apoptosis in activated hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Through manipulating animals' daily feeding schedules and caloric intake, we have found that the impaired hair regeneration is primarily caused by the extended fasting periods within these regimens, rather than a reduction in total caloric intake or alterations in circadian rhythm. As the fasting period lengthens, the severity of the defects worsens. Mechanistically, extended periods of fasting activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, prompting the release of lipolytic hormones from the adrenal glands into circulation. This triggers rapid lipolysis in dermal adipocytes, elevating levels of free fatty acids within the skin. Consequently, fatty acid oxidation is activated in HFSCs, causing increased cellular oxidative stress and apoptosis. Surgical removal of adrenal glands, genetic inhibition of fatty acid oxidation in HFSCs, or enhancement of HFSCs’ antioxidant capability genetically or pharmaceutically prevents fasting-induced stem cell death. Our study reveals a detrimental effect of intermittent fasting on somatic stem cells and peripheral tissue regeneration, and identifies a close crosstalk between an ancient neuroendocrine mechanism and a critical niche component that functions as a “brake” to halt tissue regeneration when the supply of nutrients becomes unstable.",

    "Summary": "Skin wound healing due to full thickness wounds typically results in fibrosis and scarring, where parenchyma tissue is replaced with connective tissue. A major advance in wound healing research would be to instead promote tissue regeneration. Helminth parasites express excretory/secretory (ES) molecules, which can modulate mammalian host responses. One recently discovered ES protein, TGF-β mimic (TGM), binds the TGF- receptor, though likely has other activities. Here we demonstrate that topical administration of TGM under a Tegaderm bandage enhanced wound healing and tissue regeneration in an in vivo wound biopsy model. Increased restoration of normal tissue structure in the wound beds of TGM-treated mice was observed during mid- to late-stage wound healing. Both accelerated re-epithelialization and hair follicle regeneration were observed. Further analysis showed differential expansion of myeloid populations at different wound healing stages, suggesting recruitment and reprogramming of specific macrophage subsets. This study indicates a role for TGM as a potential therapeutic option for enhanced wound healing.",

    "Summary": "Keratinocytes from healthy donors stimulated with type 2 cytokines are often used to experimentally study atopic dermatitis (AD) inflammatory responses. Due to potential intrinsic alterations, it seems favorable to use keratinocytes from AD patients. Keratinocytes isolated from hair follicles offer a non-invasive approach to investigate AD-derived keratinocytes. To evaluate whether such AD-derived keratinocytes are suitable to mimic AD inflammatory responses we compared hair follicle-derived keratinocytes from healthy donors and AD patients in a type 2 cytokine environment. Stimulation of AD-derived keratinocytes with IL-4 and IL-13 induced higher expression changes of AD-associated markers as compared to healthy keratinocytes. The combination of IL-4 and IL-13 generally induced highest expression changes, but IL-13 alone also induced significant changes of AD-specific markers. Similar to the 2D cultures, IL-4/IL-13 stimulation of 3D skin models generated with AD-derived keratinocytes modulated the expression of several AD-relevant factors. Whole transcriptome analysis revealed that IL-4 and IL-13 acted similarly on these 3D skin models. Histologically, IL-13 alone and in combination with IL-4 increased epidermal spongiosis, a histological hallmark of AD skin. Taken together, our pilot study suggests that hair follicle-derived keratinocytes from AD patients represent a useful model system to study AD-related inflammation in a personalized in vitro model.",

    "Summary": "IL-33 is constitutively expressed in many epithelial tissues at steady state and signals through the receptor, ST2. IL-33 is released upon tissue injury and functions as an endogenous danger signal to alert the immune system to tissue damage. Here we investigate the physiological role of the IL-33/ST2 axis in skin homeostasis and cancer development. We show that expression of IL-33 differentiates malignant from normal/benign human tissues and that in mouse models of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma the IL-33/ST2 axis protects against carcinogenesis. Tissue Treg are the predominant cells expressing ST2 in the skin and localise around the hair follicle and IL-33+ epithelial cells (EC). Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrate that skin Treg regulate EC differentiation, minimizes mutational load and retrains cancer development following exposure to an environmental carcinogen. Our findings indicate an important role for direct EC-Treg cross-talk as an early checkpoint to contain tissue damage and carcinogenesis.",

Hair follicle-specific genetic depletion of either JAK1/2 or STAT1 or therapeutic inhibition of JAK1/2 ameliorated the inflammation, restored skin barrier function and activated the residual stem cells to resume hair growth in mouse models of epidermal and hair follicle-specific EGFR deletion. Skin biopsies from EGFR inhibitor-treated and cicatricial alopecia patients indicated active STAT1 signalling and interferon target expression. Notably, a case study of folliculitis decalvans, characterized by progressive hair loss, scaling and perifollicular erythema, demonstrated successful treatment with JAK1/2 inhibition.

    "Summary": "Macrophages and dendritic cells have long been appreciated for their ability to migrate to and engulf dying cells and debris, including some of the billions of cells that are naturally eliminated from our body daily. However, a substantial amount of these dying cells are cleared by local tissue cells, so-called ‘non-professional phagocytes’, critical to preserve organismal fitness. How non-professional phagocytes are able to sense and digest nearby apoptotic corpses while still performing their normal tissue functions is unclear. Here, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this balancing act. Exploiting the cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration and degeneration during the hair cycle, we show that stem cells can transiently become non-professional phagocytes when confronted with dying cells. Adoption of this phagocytic state requires not only local lipids produced by apoptotic corpses, which are necessary for RXRα activation, but also tissue-specific retinoids able to activate RARg. The dual factor dependency enables tight regulation of the genes requisite to activate phagocytic apoptotic clearance. The tunable phagocytic program we describe here offers an attractive mechanism to offset phagocytic duties against the primary stem cell function of replenishing differentiated cells to preserve tissue integrity during homeostasis. Our findings have broad implications for other non-motile stem or progenitor cells which experience cell death in an immune-privileged niche.",

    "Summary": "Epidermal stem cells constantly rejuvenate the skin’s barrier, which excludes harmful microbes and prevents dehydration. In routine wounds, underlying hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), normally dedicated to hair regeneration, must also reconstruct and thereafter maintain the overlying epidermis. How these fate choices are balanced to restore physiologic function to damaged tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover the non-essential amino acid serine as a surprising rheostat in this process. Utilizing diet and HFSC-specific loss-of-function studies, we show that under serine-depleted conditions, HFSCs delay hair growth, and upon injury skew their fate towards epidermal re-epithelialization while concomitantly limiting hair growth. Combining temporal single-cell RNA sequencing, genetics and pharmacological intervention, we show that serine deficiency augments an injury-activated integrated stress response (ISR), boosting re-epithelization and rapidly restoring the skin’s barrier at the wound edge. Our findings integrate injury, the ISR, metabolism, tissue fate-selection and repair, offering potential for dietary and pharmacologic intervention to accelerate wound healing.",

    "Summary": "Epidermal stem cells constantly rejuvenate the skin’s barrier, which excludes harmful microbes and prevents dehydration. In routine wounds, underlying hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), normally dedicated to hair regeneration, must also reconstruct and thereafter maintain the overlying epidermis. How these fate choices are balanced to restore physiologic function to damaged tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we uncover the non-essential amino acid serine as a surprising rheostat in this process. Utilizing diet and HFSC-specific loss-of-function studies, we show that under serine-depleted conditions, HFSCs delay hair growth, and upon injury skew their fate towards epidermal re-epithelialization while concomitantly limiting hair growth. Combining temporal single-cell RNA sequencing, genetics and pharmacological intervention, we show that serine deficiency augments an injury-activated integrated stress response (ISR), boosting re-epithelization and rapidly restoring the skin’s barrier at the wound edge. Our findings integrate injury, the ISR, metabolism, tissue fate-selection and repair, offering potential for dietary and pharmacologic intervention to accelerate wound healing.",

    "Summary": "It has been demonstrated that CXCL12 inhibits hair growth via CXCR4, and its neutralizing antibody (Ab) increases hair growth in alopecia areata (AA). However, the molecular mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we further prepared humanized CXCL12 Ab for AA treatment and investigated underlying molecular mechanisms using single-cell RNA sequencing. Subcutaneous injection of humanized CXCL12 Ab significantly delayed AA onset in mice, and dorsal skin was analyzed. T cells and dendritic cells/macrophages were increased in the AA model, but decreased after CXCL12 Ab treatment. Pseudobulk RNA sequencing identified 153 differentially expressed genes that were upregulated in AA model and downregulated after Ab treatment. Gene ontology analysis revealed that immune cell chemotaxis and cellular response to type II interferon were upregulated in AA model but downregulated after Ab treatment. We further identified key immune cell-related genes such as Ifng, Cd8a, Ccr5, Ccl4, Ccl5, and Il21r, which were colocalized with Cxcr4 in T cells and regulated by CXCL12 Ab treatment. Notably, CD8+ T cells were significantly increased and activated via Jak/Stat pathway in the AA model but inactivated after CXCL12 Ab treatment. Collectively, these results indicate that humanized CXCL12 Ab is promising for AA treatment via immune modulatory effects.",

    "Summary": "Despite epidermal turnover, the skin is host to a complex array of microbes including viruses, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV), which must infect and manipulate skin keratinocyte stem cells (KSC) to survive. This crosstalk between the virome and KSC populations remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of HPV8 on KSCs using various mouse models. We observed that the HPV8 early region gene E6 specifically caused Lrig1+hair follicle junctional zone KSC proliferation and expansion, which would facilitate viral transmission. Within Lrig1+KSCs specifically, HPV8 E6 bound intracellular p300 to phosphorylate the STAT3 transcriptional regulatory node. This induces a transcriptional switch from TAp63 to ΔNp63 expression, resulting in expansion of KSC into the overlying epidermis. HPV8 was associated with 70% of human actinic keratoses (AK). Together these results redefine human AK as an expansion of KSC, which lack protecting melanosomes and are thus susceptible to sun-light-induced malignant transformation.",
    "Overall_Design": "To determine why HPV8 induced selective proliferation of the Lrig1+hair follicle junctional zone keratinocyte stem cells, but not other keratinocyte stem cells, we undertook a transcriptomic analysis of adjacent stem cell populations defined by Lrig1 and CD34 expression in adult mice.

    "Summary": "Disorders in the regulatory arm of the adaptive immune system result in autoimmune-mediated diseases. While systemic immunosuppression is the prevailing approach to manage them, it fails to achieve long-lasting remission due to concomitant suppression of the regulatory arm and carries the risk of heightened susceptibility to infections and malignancies. Alopecia Areata is a condition characterized by localized hair loss due to autoimmunity. The accessibility of the skin provides an opportunity for local rather than systemic intervention to avoid broad immunosuppression. We hypothesized that expansion of endogenous regulatory T cells (Tregs) at the site of antigen encounter can restore the immune balance and generate a long-lasting tolerogenic response. We therefore utilized a hydrogel microneedle (MN) patch for delivery of CCL22, a chemoattractant for Tregs, and IL-2, a Treg survival factor to amplify them. In an immune-mediated murine model of alopecia, we showed local bolstering of Treg numbers leading to sustained hair regrowth and attenuation of inflammatory pathways. In a humanized skin transplant mouse model, we confirmed expansion of Tregs within human skin without engendering peripheral immunosuppression. The MN patch offered high-loading capacity and shelf-life stability for prospective clinical translation. By harmonizing immune responses locally, we aspire to reshape the landscape of autoimmune skin disease management.",

Histologically, AK is characterized by mixed leukocytic infiltrates in the acute stage followed by a granulomatous reaction and extensive fibrosis in later stages. To further explore its pathogenesis, bulk RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing were applied to scalp biopsy specimens of lesional and adjacent non-lesional skin in patients with clinically active disease. Unbiased clustering revealed 18 distinct cell populations, including two notable populations, POSTN+ fibroblasts with enriched extracellular matrix signatures, and SPP1+ myeloid cells M2 macrophages. Cell communication analyses indicate that fibroblasts and myeloid cells communicate by collagen and SPP1 signaling networks in lesional skin. Tissue immunofluorescence staining demonstrated SPP1+ myeloid cells and POSTN+ fibroblasts at the upper segment of outer root sheath of the hair follicle in the subacute stage, confirming micro-anatomic specificity with relevant disease activity. Therapy with intralesional corticosteroids reduced SPP1 and POSTN expression, and lessened AK progression. In summary, the communication between POSTN+ fibroblasts and SPP1+ myeloid cells by collagen and SPP1 axis may contribute to the pathogenesis of AK.",

    "Summary": "Cellular quiescence is a reversible and tightly regulated stem cell function that is essential for healthy aging. However, the control elements of tissue-specific renewal, quiescence, and aging remain poorly understood. Using melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) to model and test the regulation of tissue-specific quiescence, we find that stem cell quiescence is neither a singular nor static process. McSCs display remarkable heterogeneity, with a fraction expressing the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1. Differential gene expression profiling identifies tissue-specific control of this immune privilege, specifically during melanocyte stem cell dormancy. In vitro quiescence assays confirm that inducing quiescence is sufficient to drive PD-L1 expression in melanoblasts and PD-L1 subsequently regulates aspects of melanoblast cell cycling. In vivo, a portion of McSCs appear to leverage this immune checkpoint as a key aspect of their dynamics during the dormant stage of the hair cycle. With age, this dynamic becomes unbalanced, tipping towards a higher proportion of PD-L1-expressing McSCs and a more deeply quiescent McSC pool. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that immune checkpoint expression is a physiological attribute of McSC quiescence and offer PD-L1-expressing quiescent stem cells as molecular targets for potential reactivation in regenerative and gerontological medicine.",
    "Overall_Design": "Dermis from postnatal day 0.5, 8-10-week, and 24-month mouse body skin was dissociated and processed using flow cytometry to obtain enriched populations of melanoblasts, adult quiescent melanocyte stem cells (qMcSCs) and aged qMcSCs, respectively. Cells of the melanocyte lineage were identified by their surface expression of the receptor KIT and the absence of the immune cell marker CD45. Melanoblasts in the P0.5 dermis are located within developing hair follicles. Enrichment for qMcSCs at both the adult and aged timepoints was achieved by isolating KIT+CD45- cells from mouse skin whose hair was in the telogen stage of the hair cycle. McSC enrichment at telogen is dependent on the fact that telogen hairs contain only McSCs and do not contain differentiated melanocytes. The telogen stage of the hair cycle was confirmed by the pinkness of the skin. Female mice were used for all melanoblast and McSC enrichments as it is technically challenging to dissociate and obtain cells of high quality from male skin. Melanoblasts and McSCs from several animals were pooled to generate enough RNA to serve as one biological replicate. Amplified cDNA was created from 20 ng total RNA using the Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (Tecan Genomics). The cDNA was fragmented using a Covaris E210 before proceeding to library construction with 1000ng cDNA using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit, version 2 (Illumina) using 10 PCR cycles. Libraries were pooled in equimolar ratio and sequenced together on a HiSeq 2500 with version 3 flow cells and sequencing reagents. At least 60 million 126-base read pairs were generated for each library. Data were processed using RTA 1.18.64 and CASAVA 1.8.2. RNA-Seq reads that passed the Illumina platform quality check were used for downstream analyses.",

In the present study, we observed that Dab2 is expressed in all the compartments of the hair follicle. K14 Cre specific homozygous Dab2 knockout resulted in delayed activation of HFSCs and delayed Ist hair follicle cycle initiation. At PD68, both WT and Dab2 cKO mice were at telogen. In addition, loss of Dab2 also led to reduced HFSCs pool extended quiescence, and reduced self renewal capacity of HFSCs at PD68. We performed expression profiling of HFSCs isolated from WT and Dab2 cKO mice at PD68 to check for the differentially regulated genes involved in HFSCs activation. The expression analysis helped us to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms involved in Dab2 mediated regulation of HFSCs activation and quiescence.",

    "Summary": "Stem cells upended from their niche upon injury display lineage plasticity, a transient multi-lineage state essential for tissue repair. Employing high-throughput approaches and three-dimensional cultures of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs), we investigate the signals that govern the transition between homeostatic regeneration and lineage plasticity. We identify retinoic acid (RA) as a master orchestrator of HFSC behavior during these two processes. In the hair follicle, RA signals within defined niches and interacts with WNT and BMP cues to drive hair regeneration. In wounded skin, reduced RA signaling prompts HFSCs to prioritize epidermal re-epithelialization and must be restored to promote hair regrowth. Substantiated in vivo, our findings have profound therapeutic implications for hair growth and for chronic wounds and cancers, where lineage plasticity is unresolved.",

    "Summary": "Melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) of the hair follicle are a rare cell population within the skin and are notably underrepresented in whole-skin, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. Using a cell enrichment strategy to isolate KIT+/CD45- cells from the telogen skin of adult female C57BL/6J mice, we evaluated the transcriptional landscape of quiescent McSCs (qMcSCs) at high resolution. Through this evaluation, we confirmed existing molecular signatures for qMcCS subpopulations (e.g., Kit+, Cd34+/-, Plp1+, Cd274+/-, Thy1+, Cdh3+/-) and identified novel qMcSC subpopulations, including two that differentially regulate their immune privilege status. Within qMcSC subpopulations, we also predicted melanocyte differentiation potential, neural crest potential, and quiescence depth. Taken together, the results demonstrate that the qMcSC population is heterogenous and future studies focused on investigating changes in qMcSCs should consider changes in subpopulation composition.",
    "Overall_Design": "Follicular melanocyte stem cells reside in the cellular state of quiescence for the majority of their lifespan and are essential for the regeneration of hair pigmentation during hair cycling. Functional, anatomical and molecular evidence indicates that quiescent melanocyte stem cells are heterogenous and this heterogeneity is a characteristic that defines the stem and lineage potential of these cells. To further interrogate the transcriptional programs that drive this heterogeneity we isolated quiescent melanocyte stem cells from the dermis of female, 8-week-old, C57BL/6J mice (n=3) using KIT+/CD45- enrichment using flow cytometry. Isolated quiescent melanocyte stem cells were processed for single cell RNA-seq (10X genomics) to generate a high resolution map of these cells (5545 total cells analyzed after quality control and filtering). We also performed single cell RNA-seq on dissociated dermis without enrichment as a comparison.",

    "Summary": "Finasteride is commonly prescribed to treat benign prostate hyperplasia and male-pattern baldness in cis men and, more recently, trans individuals. However, the effect of finasteride on cardiovascular disease remains elusive. We evaluated the role of finasteride on atherosclerosis using low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient (Ldlr-/-) mice. Next, we examined the relevance to humans by analysing the data deposited between 2009 and 2016 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We show that finasteride reduces total plasma cholesterol and delays the development of atherosclerosis in Ldlr-/- mice. Finasteride reduced monocytosis, monocyte recruitment to the lesion, macrophage lesion content, and necrotic core area, the latter of which is an indicator of plaque vulnerability in humans. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a downregulation of inflammatory pathways and an upregulation of bile acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and cholesterol pathways in the liver of mice taking finasteride. Men reporting the use of finasteride showed lower plasma levels of cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol than those not taking the drug. Our data unveil finasteride as a potential treatment to delay cardiovascular disease in people by improving the plasma lipid profile.",
    "Overall_Design": "Male Ldlr-/- were fed Western diet without finasteride or the same diet supplemented with 1000 mg finasteride/kg for 12 weeks.

Using a novel in vitro model of fibrosis based on endogenously produced extracellular matrix, we screened an FDA-approved compound library and identified antivirals as a class of drug not previously associated with anti-fibrotic action. Pre-clinical validation of our lead hit, daclatasvir, in a mouse model of RDEB demonstrated significant improvement in fibrosis as well as overall quality of life with increased survival, weight gain and activity, and a decrease in pruritus-induced hair loss. Immunohistochemical assessment of daclatasvir-treated RDEB mouse skin showed a reduction in fibrotic markers, which was supported by in vitro data demonstrating TGFβ pathway targeting and a reduction of total collagen retained in the extracellular matrix. Our data support clinical development of antivirals for treatment of patients with RDEB and potentially other fibrotic diseases.",

    "Summary": "Despite epidermal turnover, the skin is host to a complex array of microbes including viruses, such as the human papillomavirus (HPV), which must infect and manipulate skin keratinocyte stem cells (KSC) to survive. This crosstalk between the virome and KSC populations remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of HPV8 on KSCs using various mouse models. We observed that the HPV8 early region gene E6 specifically caused Lrig1+hair follicle junctional zone KSC proliferation and expansion, which would facilitate viral transmission. Within Lrig1+KSCs specifically, HPV8 E6 bound intracellular p300 to phosphorylate the STAT3 transcriptional regulatory node. This induces a transcriptional switch from TAp63 to ΔNp63 expression, resulting in expansion of KSC into the overlying epidermis. HPV8 was associated with 70% of human actinic keratoses (AK). Together these results redefine human AK as an expansion of KSC, which lack protecting melanosomes and are thus susceptible to sun-light-induced malignant transformation.",
    "Overall_Design": "To determine whether HPV8 E6-driven Lrig1+ hair follicle junctional zone keratinocyte stem cell proliferation was sufficient to cause expansion into the overlying epidermis by lineage tracing we generated Lrig1CreERT2:R26RConfetti:HPV8-E6tg and Lrig1CreERT2:R26RConfetti:WT mice. Confetti labeled cells were isolated by flow-cytometry, enabling us to simultaneously identify Lrig1+ cells by antibody labeling, such that we could isolate flow-sorted Lrig1+ confetti+ and their Lrig1- confetti+ progeny. Lrig1+ confetti+ and their Lrig1- confetti+ progeny from both HPV8-E6tg and WT mice were sequenced by RNA-seq and gene expression profiling analysis was performed on the dataset.",

Keratinocytes and melanocytes respond to UV exposure by eliciting a tanning response. However, how keratinocytes and melanocytes interact in the absence of UV exposure is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that after Spry1 knockout in epidermal keratinocytes, melanocyte stem cells (McSCs) in the hair follicle exit the stem cell niche without depleting the pool of these cells. We also found that McSCs migrate to the epidermis in a Scf/C-kit-dependent manner induced by a tanning-like response resulting from Spry1 loss in epidermal keratinocytes. Once there, these cells differentiate into functional melanocytes. These findings show the potential for developing therapies for skin pigmentation disorders by manipulating McSCs.",

    "Summary": "DNA damage represents one of the cell intrinsic causes of stem cell aging, which leads to differentiation induced removal of damaged stem cells in skin and blood. Dietary restriction (DR) retards aging across various species including several strains of laboratory mice. Whether, DR has the potential to ameliorate DNA damage driven stem cell exhaustion remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that DR strongly extends the time to hair graying in response to γ–irradiation (IR) induced DNA damage of C57BL/6J mice. The study shows that DR prolongs quiescence of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) by silencing gene regulatory networks and metabolic switches that control proliferation and tissue regeneration. DR-mediated prolongation of HSFC quiescence blocks hair growth and prevents the depletion of HFSCs and ckit+ melanoblasts in response to IR. However, prolongation of HSFCs quiescence also leads to a suppression of DNA repair pathways and cannot prevent melanoblast loss and hair graying in the long run, when hair cycling is re- initiated even after extended periods of time. Together, these results support a model indicating that nutrient deprivation can delay but not heal DNA damage driven extinction of HFSCs and melanoblasts by stalling HSFCs in a prolonged state of quiescence coupled with inhibition of DNA repair. Disconnecting these two types of responses to DR could have the potential to delay stem cell aging.",

    "Summary": "The epigenetic repressor BMI1 plays an integral role in promoting the self-renewal and proliferation of many adult stem cell populations, and also tumor types, primarily through silencing the Cdkn2a locus, which encodes the tumor suppressors p16Ink4a and p19Arf. However, in cutaneous melanoma, BMI1 drives epithelial-mesenchymal transition programs, and thus metastasis, while having little impact on proliferation or primary tumor growth. This raised questions about the requirement and role for BMI1 in melanocyte stem cell (MeSC) biology. Here, we demonstrate that murine melanocyte-specific Bmi1 deletion causes premature hair greying, which results from gradual MeSC loss. We establish that MeSC loss begins in the second hair cycle and is accompanied by melanocyte depletion. RNA-seq of MeSCs revealed that Bmi1 deletion induces transcriptional upregulation of p16Ink4a and p19Arf, mirroring the central role of BMI1 in other stem cell contexts. Additionally, the glutathione S-transferase enzymes Gsta1 and Gsta2 are downregulated by BMI1 loss, raising the possibility that MeSCs could be susceptible to oxidative stress. Accordingly, treatment with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) partially rescued melanocyte expansion. Together, our data establish a critical role for BMI1 in MeSC maintenance that reflect a partial role for suppression of oxidative stress, and likely transcriptional repression of Cdkn2a.",

    "Summary": "Tight immune defense against environment and a unique ability of self-repair are the hallmarks of epithelia. Here we show that innate immunity Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2) coordinates these key functions thereby promoting hair growth and tissue regeneration. TLR2 is enriched in hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and its levels change in hair cycle and skin disorders. The lack of TLR2 in HFSCs diminishes activation and proliferation of HFSCs markedly prolonging the resting phase of hair cycle. Transcriptome profiling of HFSCs revealed that TLR2 regulates main hair regeneration pathways. TLR2 deletion upregulates inhibitory BMP7 signaling, while the blockade by Noggin restores deficient HFSCs proliferation in the absence of TLR2. In injury model TLR2 is required for both, tissue and hair regeneration. While endothelial TLR2 drives wound revascularization and closure, HFSC TLR2 controls hair regrowth. Endogenous TLR2 ligand produced in hair follicles promotes hair regeneration and growth via HFSC TLR2. Together, HFSC TLR2 drives stem cell proliferation, hair cycle and regeneration.",

    "Summary": "Regorafenib has anti-tumor activity in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC) with potential immunomodulatory effects, suggesting that its combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor may have clinically meaningful benefits in patients with uHCC. The multicenter, single-arm, phase 2 RENOBATE trial tested regorafenib-nivolumab as front-line treatment for uHCC. Forty-two patients received nivolumab 480 mg every 4 weeks and regorafenib 80 mg daily (3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule). The primary endpoint was the investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. The secondary endpoints included safety, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR per RECIST version 1.1 was 31.0%, meeting the primary endpoint. The most common adverse events were palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (38.1%), alopecia (26.2%) and skin rash (23.8%). Median PFS was 7.38 months. The 1-year OS rate was 80.5%, and the median OS was not reached. Exploratory single-cell RNA sequencing analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed that long-term responders exhibited T cell receptor repertoire diversification, enrichment of genes representing immunotherapy responsiveness in MKI67+ proliferating CD8+ T cells and a higher probability of M1-directed monocyte polarization. Our data support further clinical development of the regorafenib-nivolumab combination as front-line treatment for uHCC and provide preliminary insights on immune biomarkers of response.

Limited understanding of how epidermal progenitors specialize to form these vital organs has precluded therapeutic efforts toward their regeneration. Herein, we applied single-nucleus transcriptomics to compare the expression content of wild-type, eccrine-forming mouse skin to that of mice harboring a skin-specific disruption of Engrailed 1 (En1), a transcription factor that promotes eccrine gland formation in humans and mice. We identify two concurrent but disproportionate epidermal transcriptomes in the early eccrine anlagen: one that is shared with hair follicles and one that is En1 dependent and eccrine specific. We demonstrate that eccrine development requires the induction of a dermal niche proximal to each developing gland in humans and mice. Our study defines the signatures of eccrine identity and uncovers the eccrine dermal niche, setting the stage for targeted regeneration and comprehensive skin repair.",

Using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis and K14-Cre-Twist1 transgenic mice, we identified the central role of the Twist1 pathway as the mediator of epidermal-dermal interaction and the emergence of periodic hair primordia. Lastly, we generated a Turing model with an underlying measure of stiffness to support a two-scale tissue mechanic model to explain the setup of a morphogenetic field from a wound bed (mm scale) or periodically arranged hair primordia from a morphogenetic field (μm scale). Delineating the common and distinct chemo-mechanical events during regenerative wound healing between laboratory and African spiny mice reveal its evo-devo advantages, which provide new perspectives for regenerative medicine.",

    "Summary": "The Vitamin D receptor (VDR) is essential for hair follicle homeostasis as its deficiency leads to hair loss. However, the mechanism behind this relationship is unknown. Our research shows that in VDR knockout mice, the hair cycle is halted during the catagen stage, preceding alopecia. Additionally, in VDR knockout hair follicles, epithelial strands that normally regress during the catagen phase persist as \"surviving epithelial strands.\" Analysis using single cell RNA sequencing suggests these surviving epithelial strands are formed by cells in the lower part of the hair follicle. These findings emphasize the importance of the regression phase in hair follicle regeneration and establish the VDR as a regulator of the catagen stage.",

    "Summary": "Macrophages and dendritic cells have long been appreciated for their ability to migrate to and engulf dying cells and debris, including some of the billions of cells that are naturally eliminated from our body daily. However, a substantial amount of these dying cells are cleared by local tissue cells, so-called ‘non-professional phagocytes’, critical to preserve organismal fitness. How non-professional phagocytes are able to sense and digest nearby apoptotic corpses while still performing their normal tissue functions is unclear. Here, we explore the molecular mechanisms underlying this balancing act. Exploiting the cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration and degeneration during the hair cycle, we show that stem cells can transiently become non-professional phagocytes when confronted with dying cells. Adoption of this phagocytic state requires not only local lipids produced by apoptotic corpses, which are necessary for RXRα activation, but also tissue-specific retinoids able to activate RARg. The dual factor dependency enables tight regulation of the genes requisite to activate phagocytic apoptotic clearance. The tunable phagocytic program we describe here offers an attractive mechanism to offset phagocytic duties against the primary stem cell function of replenishing differentiated cells to preserve tissue integrity during homeostasis. Our findings have broad implications for other non-motile stem or progenitor cells which experience cell death in an immune-privileged niche.",

    "Summary": "Skin is the largest organ in the body and comprises several types of cells. The intercellular plasticity of keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and skin adipocytes contributes to wound healing and dermal adipogenesis. Although keratinocyte activates dermal adipose tissue (dWAT) differentiation upon hair follicular cycle, regulating dWAT hyperplasia through keratinocyte reprogramming is still unknown. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 base editor to induce single nucleotide polymorphisms in Forkhead-box N1 (Foxn1) and identified the p.L19M variant that induced the formation of a thicker dWAT regardless of hair follicular cycle or wound healing. Foxn1 p.L19M activates Wnt5β through transcriptional activity. Wnt5β signaling induces the conversion of dWAT dermal fibroblasts into adipose precursor cells (APCs) and promotes APC adipocyte differentiation through keratinocyte epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and adipogenic signaling. Wnt5β is involved in the entire process of dWAT hyperplasia through APC supply and adipogenic signaling as a single factor. Foxn1 p.L19M and Wnt5β are expressed in keratinocytes, and a keratinocyte-derived adipogenic signal is critical for dermal adipogenesis. In addition, transient expression of Foxn1 p.L19M or Wnt5β using adeno-associated virus reproduced dermal adipocyte hyperplasia in mice. Considering the increasing importance of dWAT in functions such as the immune response, wound healing, hair follicle growth, and temperature control, this finding has potential applications in skin regeneration",

Fast-conducting, rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors innervating glabrous (non-hairy) skin form Meissner corpuscles, while in hairy skin, they associate with hair follicles, forming longitudinal lanceolate endings. How mechanoreceptors develop axonal endings appropriate for their skin targets is unknown. We report that mechanoreceptor morphologies across different skin regions are indistinguishable during early development but diverge post-natally, in parallel with skin maturation. Neurons terminating along the glabrous and hairy skin border exhibit hybrid morphologies, forming both Meissner corpuscles and lanceolate endings. Additionally, molecular profiles of neonatal glabrous and hairy skin-innervating neurons largely overlap. In mouse mutants with ectopic glabrous skin, mechanosensory neurons form end-organs appropriate for the altered skin type. Finally, BMP5 and BMP7 are enriched in glabrous skin, and signaling through type I bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors in neurons is critical for Meissner corpuscle morphology. Thus, mechanoreceptor morphogenesis is flexibly instructed by target tissues.",

    "Summary": "Alopecia areata (AA) is among the most prevalent autoimmune diseases, but the development of innovative therapeutic strategies has lagged due to an incomplete understanding of the immunological underpinnings of disease. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of skin-infiltrating immune cells from the graft-induced C3H/HeJ mouse model of AA, coupled with antibody-based depletion to interrogate the functional role of specific cell types in AA in vivo. Since AA is predominantly T cell-mediated, we focused on dissecting lymphocyte function in AA. Both our scRNAseq and functional studies established CD8+ T cells as the primary disease-driving cell type in AA. Only the depletion of CD8+ T cells, but not CD4+ T cells, NK, B, or γδ T cells, was sufficient to prevent and reverse AA. Selective depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) showed that Treg are protective against AA in C3H/HeJ mice, suggesting that AA failure of Treg-mediated immunosuppression is not a major disease mechanism. Focused analyses of CD8+ T cells revealed five subsets, whose heterogeneity is defined by an ‘effectorness gradient’ of interrelated transcriptional states that culminate in increased effector function and tissue residency. scRNAseq of human AA skin showed that CD8+ T cells in human AA follow a similar trajectory, underscoring that shared mechanisms drive disease in both murine and human AA. Our study represents a comprehensive, systematic interrogation of lymphocyte heterogeneity in AA, and uncovers a framework for AA-associated CD8+ T cells with implications for the design of future therapeutics.",

    "Summary": "While cell division is essential for self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells and progenitors, dormancy is required to maintain the structure and function of the stem-cell niche. Here we use the hair follicle to show that during growth, the mesenchymal niche of the hair follicle, the dermal papilla (DP), is maintained quiescent by the activity of Hdac1 and Hdac2 in the DP that suppresses the expression of cell-cycle genes. Furthermore, Hdac1 and Hdac2 in the DP promote the survival of DP cells throughout the hair cycle. While during growth and regression this includes downregulation of p53 activity and the control of p53-independent programs, during quiescence, this predominantly involves p53-independent mechanisms. Remarkably, Hdac1 and Hdac2 in the DP during the growth phase also participate in orchestrating the hair cycle clock by maintaining physiological levels of Wnt signaling in the vicinity of the DP. Our findings not only provide insight into the molecular mechanism that sustains the function of the stem-cell niche in a persistently changing microenvironment, but also unveil that the same mechanism provides a molecular toolbox allowing the DP to affect and fine tune the microenvironment.",

    "Summary": "To date, diagnosis of methamphetamine use disorder (MUD) is based primarily on the patient’s self-reports of drug-seeking behaviour and interviews with psychiatrists in the absence of objective biomarkers. As an effective clinical method for diagnosis of MUD is still not available, the development of potential biomarkers for more accurate diagnosis is imperative. Transcription profiling and discovery of biomarkers in the treatment and recovery periods of MUD patients can be used as scientific basis to provide a greater understanding of the disease and to facilitate decisions on whether to continue or not. In this study, RNA sequencing analysis was performed to profile transcripts from hair follicle cells of healthy controls and patients with MUD, and biomarkers were discovered at each transition states to be used to diagnose MUD. This study will present an important information to diagnose MUD using non-invasive biomarkers for human addicts and it will help to develop better pharmacological treatment of MUD in the future.",

    "Summary": "While fats are essential nutrients in healthy diets, how dietary fats affect immune cell function and overall health are not well understood. We fed mice various high-fat diets (HFD) which mimicked human diets rich in different fatty acid (FA) components. Surprisingly, we observed that mice consuming the fish oil diet exhibited the most severe hair loss compared to those consuming other diets, which supported the evidence that people in regions with a high intake of fish had a tendency of increased hair loss. Mechanistically, omega-3 FAs in fish oil promoted atypical expansion of skin CD8+γδ+ T cells which inhibited hair follicle stem cell activity. We further identified that the epidermal fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) was pivotal in promoting omega-3 FA-induced CD8+γδ+ T cells by activating the reactive oxygen species (ROS)/IL-36 signaling pathway in dermis macrophages. Our findings have implications for the prevention, etiology and therapy of hair loss in humans, including these with alopecia areata.",

    "Summary": "Skin-injury and several diseases elicit fibrosis and induce hair follicle (HF)-growth arrest and loss. Resulting alopecia and disfiguration represent a severe burden for patients both physically and psychologically. Reduction of pro-fibrotic factors such as DPP4 might be a strategy to tackle this issue. We demonstrate DPP4-overrepresentation in settings with HF-growth arrest (telogen), HF-loss and non-regenerative wound areas in mice skin and human scalp. Topical DPP4-inhibition (DPP4i) with FDA/EMA-approved Sitagliptin (Sit) on preclinical models of murine HF-activation/regeneration results in accelerated anagen-progress, while treatment of wounds with Sit results in reduced expression of fibrosis markers, increased induction of anagen around wounds, and HF-regeneration in the wound center. These effects are associated with higher expression of Wnt-target Lef1, known to be required for HF-anagen (HF-activation)/regeneration. Sit-treatment decreases pro-fibrotic signaling in the skin, induce a differentiation trajectory of HF-cells, and activate Wnt-targets related to HF-activation/growth but not those supporting fibrosis. Taken together, our study demonstrates a role for DPP4 in HF biology and shows how DPP4i, currently used as oral medication to treat diabetes, could be repurposed into a topical treatment agent to potentially reverse HF-loss in alopecia and after injury.",

    "Summary": "We investigated how the biologically active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) inhibits the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a critical step in the development of a migratory phenotype in epithelial tumor cells, as well as migration in general, using osteosarcoma (OS) as a model. We looked at how 1,25(OH)2D3 affected pre- and post-EMT migratory states in non-metastatic MG63 and metastatic LM7 OS cell models. In scratch and Boyden chamber assays, 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited cell migration and invasion, but LM7 cells responded significantly less than MG63 cells (50 vs 26 percent decrease, respectively). 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited the expression of EMT-inducing genes (e.g., SNAI2) and extracellular contact regulatory genes in MG63 cells but not in LM7 cells (e.g., CD44, MMP3). In comparison to MG63 cells, LM7 cells had significantly lower baseline VDR transcript levels but higher SNAI2 transcript levels. Furthermore, ATAC-seq analysis revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 epigenetically repressed SNAI2 in MG63 cells, implying that LM7 cells may be constitutively induced to undergo EMT via VDR de-repression mediated by increased SNAI2 levels. Both cell lines appeared to activate an antioxidative pathway involving SOD2 upregulation and concurrent reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduction (e.g., H2O2). ATAC-seq analysis revealed that 1,25(OH)2D3 does not epigenetically regulate SOD2 in MG63 cells, implying a previously unknown indirect link promoting anti-EMT and anti-metastatic oxidation states in both OS cell lines. We studied the fate and migration of mouse hair follicle stem cell progenitor cells after wounding with or without the Vdr because cutaneous wounding and metastasis involve similar signaling factors that regulate cell migration. Conditional loss of Vdr in epithelial progenitor cells promoted cell migration and wound healing in comparison to control animals, indicating that Vdr signaling inhibits cell migration in general. Our findings show that vitamin D signaling inhibits cell migration both in vivo and in vitro, and that inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) in both pre-EMT and post-EMT OS cells is a possible vitamin D mechanism and therapeutic strategy for preventing the onset and progression of OS. MG63 human osteosarcoma cell line treated with vehicle (ethanol) or 1,25(OH)D (10nM) for 24 and 48 hours.",

    "Summary": "Although most mammals heal injured tissues and organs with scarring, spiny mice (Acomys) naturally regenerate skin and complex musculoskeletal tissues. Currently, the core signaling pathways driving mammalian tissue regeneration are poorly characterized. Here, we show that, while immediate ERK activation is a shared feature of scarring (Mus) and regenerating (Acomys) injuries, ERK activity is only sustained during complex tissue regeneration. Following ERK inhibition, regeneration in Acomys shifted towards a fibrotic repair. Using scRNA-seq, we uncovered that MAPK/ERK signaling acts in a cell type specific manner to direct regenerative healing. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments prompted us to identify FGF and ErbB signaling as upstream ERK regulators of regeneration. By ectopically activating ERK in Mus injuries, a pro- regenerative response was induced, including cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling and hair follicle neogenesis. Our data provide new insights into why some mammals regenerate better than others and open avenues to redirect fibrotic repair towards regenerative healing.",

Irx5-/- mice display delayed onset of first postnatal anagen, with increased DNA damage and diminished HFSC proliferation. Through transcriptomic and epigenetic analysis, we discover the formation of open chromatin regions near key cell cycle progression- and DNA damage repair genes in Irx5-/- HFSC. We also identify DNA damage repair factors BRCA1 and BARD1 as IRX5 downstream targets. Inhibition of FGF18 kinase signaling partially rescues the anagen delay in Irx5-/- mice, indicating that the Irx5-/- HFSC quiescent phenotype is in part due to failure to suppress Fgf18 expression. Our findings identify IRX5 as a required promoter of DNA damage repair in HFSC activation and hair cycle initiation.",

    "Summary": "Purpose: To comprehensively characterize VE-cadherin expressing lineages during adult skin homeostasis, to dissect their population-specific transcriptomic heterogeneity, and to investigate role of Alk1 in these linegease in vivo. Methods: We performed 10x genomics single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of FACS sorted tdTomato+ cells from tdTomato;Cdh5-CreERT2;Krt14-H2BGFP mice (for WT) or Alk1 flox flox;tdTomato;Cdh5-CreERT2 (For Alk1KO) back skin at indicated stage/genotype. FACS purified tdTomato+ single-cell suspension was processed for the barcoded single-cell 3′ cDNA libraries generation using Chromium Single Cell 3′ gel bead and library Kit v3. The final libraries were quantified using Agilent Bioanalyzer high sensitivity DNA chip and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq-500. The raw data files were demultiplexed to generate the sample-specific FASTQ files, which were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10-2020-A) using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (v6.0.1). The raw scRNA-seq data was processed using Cell Ranger from the 10x platform to generate expression matrix for each sample that was further analyzed in R using the Seurat package version 4.0. Only high-quality cells that had between 200 and 5000 genes expressed and had under 10% of the UMIs mapped to mitochondrial genes were retained for further analysis. Results: We obtained more than 2000 high quality cells at each stage/genotype for further analysis by Seurat pipeline Conclusions: Obtained high quality single cell transcriptomic data to dissect cellular and molecular heterogeneity of VE-cadherin expressing endothelial and non-endothelial lineages in adult mouse back skin.",

    "Summary": "The repair of skin and soft tissue defects has been a long-standing topic of interest in plastic surgery. Skin grafts and flaps are the most commonly used methods for such repair, but both have some disadvantages. If a high-quality skin flap transplantation outcome could be obtained through simple skin grafting, it would surely benefit a majority of patients. Transplantation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) into skin and soft tissue wounds is a promising “therapeutic angiogenesis” strategy in this context. In the present study, we used TNF-α to mobilize ADSCs for the tissue regenerative process. Then, we injected the TNF-α-activated ADSCs intradermally into the donor skin of full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs). TNF-α may activate ADSCs through the TNF-α/NF-κB pathway and enhance the ability of ADSCs to signal the paracrine secretion of the angiogenic factor IL-8, ultimately promoting the angiogenesis of donor skin. The use of vasculature-rich donor skin for grafting presented in our study could accelerate skin graft anastomosis; shorten the nutrient deprivation time of the epidermis, hair follicles, and dermis; and thereby improve the survival of FTSGs. Overall, the findings of the present study demonstrate a possible mechanism through which TNF-α acts on ADSCs to improve their angiogenic capacity and provide a novel approach for the repair of skin and soft tissue wounds.",

Single-cell RNA sequencing were performed to explore the role of SBM for hair regeneration. Results: SBM significantly induced hair growth compared with control treatment.The results of single-cell sequencing revealed that after SBM treatment, the number of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) and dermal papilla cells (DPCs) increased significantly. Cell interactions and volcano maps show that interaction of FGF signaling pathway was significantly enhanced, in which FGF7 expression was especially upregulated in DPCs. In addition, Wnt signaling pathway also had a partially enhanced effect on the interactions between various cells in the skin. Network pharmacology study showed that the promotion of FGF and Wnt pathways by SBM was also enriched in alopecia diseases. Conclusion: We report that SBM has a potential effect on the promotion of hair growth by mainly activating FGF signaling pathway. The use of SBM may be a novel therapeutic option for hair loss.",

    "Summary": "Niche for stem cells can profoundly influence the position and fate of stem cells in tissue homeostasis and associated disorders, however, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of stem cell niche remain poorly understood. Here we report that fatty acid desaturation catabolized by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1) regulates the activity of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) via blocking the formation of the bulge, a niche for HFSCs. We further unraveled that the abnormal hair growth in mice with SCD1 deletion is due to its function in K14+ basal keratinocytes rather than directly affecting HFSCs. Mechanistically, SCD1 deficiency impaired the expression of integrin α6 and the formation of hemidesmosomes (HDs), and thus allowed the activation of FAK in K14+ keratinocytes. Activated FAK subsequently stimulated PI3K and promoted the differentiation and proliferation of these keratinocytes, resulting in downward extension of the outer root sheath (ORS) and the disruption of bulge formation. Interestingly, inhibition of PI3K signaling restored bulge formation and normalized HFSCs and hair growth. Supplementation of oleic acid, the product of SCD1, to SCD1-/- mice also enhanced HD numbers, normalized the niche of HFSCs, and promoted hair growth in SCD1-/- mice. Taken together, SCD1 is indispensable for hair growth through stabilizing the number of HDs and thus sustaining bulge formation for HFSC residence and periodic activity.",

    "Summary": "Skin aging is characterized by structural and functional changes that lead to slower wound healing and higher rate of infections, which contribute to age-associated frailty. This likely depends on synergy between alterations in the local microenvironment and stem cell–intrinsic changes, underscored by pro-inflammatory microenvironments that drive pleotropic changes. To date, little is known about the precise nature and origin of the proposed age-associated inflammatory cues, or how they affect different tissue resident cell types. Based on deep single-cell RNA-sequencing of the entire dermal compartment, we now provide a comprehensive understanding of the age-associated changes in all skin cell types. We show a previously unreported skew towards an IL-17–expressing phenotype of Th cells, γδ T cells and innate lymphoid cells in aged skin. Aberrant IL-17 signaling is common to many autoimmune (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis) and chronic inflammatory diseases. Importantly, in vivo blockade of IL-17–triggered signaling during the aging process reduces the pro-inflammatory state by affecting immune and non-immune skin cells of both dermis and epidermis. Strikingly, IL-17 neutralization significantly delays the appearance of age-related traits, such as decreased epidermal thickness, increased cornified layer thickness and ameliorated hair follicle stem cell activation and hair shaft regeneration. Our results indicate that the aged skin shows chronic and persistent signs of inflammation, and that age-associated increased IL-17 signaling could be targeted as a strategy to prevent age-associated skin ailments in elderly.",

    "Summary": "Demodex mites are obligate commensal parasites of hair follicles (HF) in mammals. Normally asymptomatic, inflammatory outgrowth of mites can accompany malnutrition, immune dysfunction and aging, but mechanisms restricting Demodex outgrowth and pathogenesis are not defined. Here, we show that control over mite HF colonization of mice requires ILC2s, IL-13, and its receptor IL-4Ra, but not IL-4 or the adaptive immune system. Epithelial HF-associated ILC2s elaborate IL-13 that attenuates HF and epithelial cell proliferation at anagen onset; in their absence, Demodex colonization leads to increased epithelial proliferation and replacement of gene programs for repair by aberrant inflammatory programs leading to loss of barrier function and premature HF exhaustion over time. Humans with rhinophymatous acne rosacea, a nasal inflammatory condition associated with a high burden of Demodex, had increased HF inflammatory cells with decreased type 2 cytokines, consistent with the inverse relationship seen in mice. Our studies uncover a critical role for skin ILC2s and IL-13, which comprise an immune checkpoint necessary to sustain cutaneous integrity and restrict pathologic infestation by colonizing HF mites.",

    "Summary": "Execution of lineage-specific differentiation programs requires tight coordination between many regulators including Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes catalyzing 5-methylcytosine oxidation in DNA. Here, by using Keratin 14-Cre-driven ablation of Tet genes in skin epithelial cells, we demonstrate that ablation of Tet2/Tet3 result in marked alterations of hair shape and length followed by hair loss. We show that through DNA demethylation, Tet2/Tet3 control chromatin accessibility, Dlx3 binding and promoter activity of the Krt25 and Krt28 genes regulating hair shape, as well as regulate interactions between the Krt28 gene promoter and distal enhancer. Moreover, Tet2/Tet3 also control three-dimensional chromatin topology in Keratin type I/II gene loci via DNA methylation-independent mechanisms. These data demonstrate the essential roles for Tet2/3 in establishment of lineage-specific gene expression program and control of Dlx3/Krt25/Krt28 axis in hair follicle epithelial cells and implicate modulation of DNA methylation as a novel approach for hair growth control.",

    "Summary": "Progenitor cell death and dermal papilla relocation during the regression phase of the hair growth cycle are essential for stem cell activation and follicle regeneration. This drastic follicle remodeling is coordinated by dermal sheath (DS) smooth muscle contraction, but how DS-generated forces are regulated is unknown. Here, we identify endothelin signaling - a potent vasoconstriction-regulating pathway - as the key activating mechanism of DS contraction. Pharmacological blocking or genetic ablation of both endothelin receptors, ETA and ETB, impedes DS contraction and halts follicle regression. Progenitors at the epithelial strand bottleneck are the main source of endothelin ligand ET-1, which is required for follicle regression. ET signaling in DS cells and downstream contraction is dynamically regulated by cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels via cell membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium channels. Together, these findings illuminate an epithelial-mesenchymal-interaction paradigm in which progenitors - before undergoing programmed cell death - control the contraction of the surrounding sheath smooth muscle to orchestrate homeostatic tissue regression and follicle reorganization.",

Slow-cycling stem cells (label retaining cells, LRCs), fast-cycling stem cells (non-label retaining cells, nLRCs) and hair follicle stem cells express unique gene signatures in young age (2 months old) and have independent stem cell identities. The changes in aging stem cells lineage identities have been a topic of discussion and here we examined if distinct stem cells cycling speed affects their aging process by comparing the transcriptomes of slow-and fast-cycling epidermal stem cells.

    "Summary": "Execution of lineage-specific differentiation programs requires tight coordination between many regulators including Ten-eleven translocation (TET) family enzymes catalyzing 5-methylcytosine oxidation in DNA. Here, by using Keratin 14-Cre-driven ablation of Tet genes in skin epithelial cells, we demonstrate that ablation of Tet2/Tet3 result in marked alterations of hair shape and length followed by hair loss. We show that through DNA demethylation, Tet2/Tet3 control chromatin accessibility, Dlx3 binding and promoter activity of the Krt25 and Krt28 genes regulating hair shape, as well as regulate interactions between the Krt28 gene promoter and distal enhancer. Moreover, Tet2/Tet3 also control three-dimensional chromatin topology in Keratin type I/II gene loci via DNA methylation-independent mechanisms. These data demonstrate the essential roles for Tet2/3 in establishment of lineage-specific gene expression program and control of Dlx3/Krt25/Krt28 axis in hair follicle epithelial cells and implicate modulation of DNA methylation as a novel approach for hair growth control. We performed RNA-seq from sorted hair matrix keratinocytes of wild type and TetDKO (Krt14-Cre, Tet2 flox/flox, Tet3 flox/flox) mice at P4.5 which are treated or untreated with 5-aza.",

    "Summary": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a pleiotropic peptide produced in the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Despite conjectures that NPY may have a role in skin physiology and pathology, the effects of NPY in this organ remain poorly understood. We reported that a knock-in mouse with entopic NPY overexpression exhibits significantly elevated NPY in the skin, accompanied by premature and progressive hair graying secondary to depletion of melanocyte stem cells within hair follicles. However, the question remains as to whether NPY overexpression in the skin can induce non-melanocyte pathology. In this study, we employed this mouse to investigate consequences of skin-specific overexpression of NPY. Our findings show that chronic NPY overexpression in the skin induces dermal fibrosis and epidermal hyperkeratosis. Additionally, NPY overexpression induces significant accumulation of macrophages and T-regs in the dermis. RNA sequencing of whole skin from NPY-overexpressing mice further reveals NPY-mediated transcriptional changes consistent with inflammatory processes and inflammation-associated skin changes. Together, these results provide long-awaited evidence of NPY’s involvement in skin pathology, providing a background for future precise definition of its role in the regulation of cutaneous homeostasis.",

    "Summary": "Transcriptome profiling reveals different expression pattern in baseline group(after isolated hair follicles---HFs,collect samples immediately), 0G group(sham irradiation, collect organ-cultured HFs for 3 days),and 5G group(5G dose irradiation, collect organ-cultured HFs for 3 days) in ex vivo organ-cultured HFs. Hair greying or canities is one of the earliest phenomena in aging. A worldwide survey based on a large sample of human subjects showed that men grey faster than women, but in distinct scalp regions, and the populations of Asian and African descent had less grey hair than those of the same age of Caucasian descent. The average grey hair age of whites is 34 ± 9.6 years in Caucasians, while 43.9 ± 10.3 years in African. And then clinical observation demonstrates that by the age of 50 in 50% of all men in senile canities, 50% of all hair follicles (HFs) have lost their pigment. In addition, an increasing number of studies found that hair greying acts as an important predictor of aging-associated pathology, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and cardiovascular disease, etc. Grey hair is both visible and non-lethal, and it makes this phenotype a unique model system for investigating mechanisms that contribute to tissue aging and therapeutic strategies to combat this process. In humans and mice, age-related grey hair is attributed to the loss of melanocyte stem cells (MeSCs), precursor cells, and melanocytes, or their reduced or restricted functions, which is induced by a multitude of exogenous and endogenous challenges, such as radiation, inflammation, psycho-emotional stress, or gene mutation (BCL-2 deficiency), etc. Of which, ionizing radiation (IR) produces multiple clusters of double-strand breaks that mediate cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair, and successfully induces grey hair in mice. The accelerating process of aging by IR may provide an avenue to create a grey hair model. Although there is a mouse model of grey hair, the existence of species differences also limits the translational potential of the mice HF models for human applications. Recently, Rachmin et al demonstrated that IR could result to ectopically pigmented melanocytes (EPM) in outer root sheath (ORS) followed hair greying and speculated that this may provide a tool to prevent or reverse hair greying in humans. They proved that different genotoxicity can induce premature differentiation of MeSCs and/or amelanotic cells. However, they didn’t determine the appropriate dose of irradiation for creating the hair grey model and not discuss the mechanisms of forming the model. Hence, this study focuses on establishing a suitable ex vivo human grey HF model by IR, demonstrating the series change of grey hair and exploring the possible mechanisms of the model. In our study, parameters about senescence and melanotic features in our model are almost in line with essential traits of human grey hair in previous studies. In addition,to explore the profound mechanism of the irradiated model, we performed transcriptome analysis for baseline, 0G and 5G groups. Then, three pairwise comparisons were established---0G vs 5G, baseline vs 5G and baseline vs 0G.

    "Summary": "Tissue stem cells preserve a certain level of potency to maintain intact tissue integrity after various injury. Postnatal dermal fibroblasts lose differentiation potential for regenerative healing that recreates normal tissue including functional hair follicles (HFs), however, their intrinsic cellular changes are not understood yet. Here, we uncover a postnatal maturation process in papillary fibroblasts (PFs) mediated by Twist2-driven chromatin and transcriptional remodeling. Within 4 days after birth, dermal PFs lost WNT transcription factors (TFs) and target gene expressions accompanied by loss of H3K27ac expression. Through single-cell transcriptomics, ATAC-seq and ChIP-seq profiling, we define a postnatal maturation trajectory of PFs, in addition to loss of regenerative trajectory, triggered by decrease of H3K27ac and chromatic accessibility. In vivo inhibition of histone deacetylation delays the postnatal chromatin remodeling and maintains developmental signaling and differentiation potential in PFs. TF motif analysis on the chromatin regions losing accessibility identifies TWIST as a potential regulator specifying these regions. Using Twist2 conditional knock-out mouse model, we unearth a postnatal role of Twist2 TF as governing the postnatal maturation process resulting in switch-off of developmental pathways after birth. Together, our findings expose a comprehensive intracellular mechanism driving postnatal maturation in dermal fibroblasts with profound implications for regenerative medicine.",
    "Overall_Design": "To define the intrinsic temporal changes in total skin cells after birth, mouse back skin was harvested and dissociated into dermal and epidermal single-cell suspension at postnatal day 0, 2 and 4 (PD0, PD2, PD4), or postnatal day 4 after intraperitoneal TSA treatment for 4 days (TPD4, 5Î¼g/g body weight).

    "Summary": "The maintenance of tissue homeostasis in steady state or under stress is dependent on the proper communication between tissue-resident stem cells (SCs) and immune cells in their microenvironment or “niche”. In addition to promoting immune tolerance, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have recently emerged as a critical component of stem cell niche in the hair follicle (HF), injured muscle, bone marrow and intestine to support stem cell differentiation. How Treg cells sense the dynamic signals in the niche environment and communicate with stem cells during tissue regeneration is largely unknown. Here, by using HF as a model, we uncover a hitherto unrecognized function of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling pathway in skin-resident Treg cells to facilitate hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) activation and HF regeneration. Ablation of GR signaling in Tregs blocked HFSCs activation and proliferation after hair depilation and during the natural hair growth cycle. Mechanistically, GR signaling induces skin-resident Tregs to produce TGF-b3, which activates Smad2/3 in HFSCs and promotes HFSC proliferation and hair growth. Our study identifies a novel crosstalk between skin-resident Tregs and HFSCs mediated by the GR/TGF-b3 axis, highlighting a new avenue to manipulate Tregs to support tissue regeneration.",

Patients with DM1 present with multisystemic symptoms, such as muscle wasting, cognitive impairment, cataract, frontal baldness, and endocrine defects, which resemble accelerated aging. Although the involvement of cellular senescence, a critical component of aging, was suggested in studies of DM1 patient-derived cells, the detailed mechanism of cellular senescence caused by CUGexp RNA remains unelucidated. Here, we developed a DM1 cell model that conditionally expressed CUGexp RNA in human primary cells so that we could perform a detailed assessment that eliminated the variability in primary cells from different origins. To identify the pathway that induced cellular senescence, we conducted comprehensive gene expression analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) in CUGexp+ and CUGexp− cells.",

    "Summary": "We find that the expression of GATA3 in skin ILCs is significantly lower than in conventional ILC2s of other tissues, indicating that the regulatory role of GATA3 may be different. Indeed, skin ILCs are still maintained after inducing Gata3 depletion in Gata3fl/flCreERT2 mice, when all ILC2s were gone. In addition, about 70% skin ILCs are found to experience RORγt expression as reflected by RORγt fate-mapping. And, conditional Gata3 depletion in the RORγt fate-mapped skin ILCs does not affect their number as well. Therefore, in contrast to conventional ILC2s, GATA3 is not required for skin ILCs for their maintenance. The RORγt fate-mapped skin ILCs have exhibited ILC3-like features. Single-cell transcriptome analysis further reveals that skin ILCs converge on a Ccr6+ ILC3-like state and an Il1rl1+ ILC2-like state. The regulatory role of GATA3 is crucial in the ILC3-like skin ILCs. It promotes the expression of their featured genes, while suppresses the expression of ILC2-like skin ILC featured genes. These ILC3-like skin ILCs locate in close proximity to hair follicles. During hair follicle recycling they migrate from isthmus to suprabulbar to promote the hair follicle growth. Whereas in absence of Gata3, the ILC3-like skin ILCs exhibit defective migration to the suprabulbar and reduced expression of the featured genes in this process. Together, our study evidence that skin ILCs are alternative to conventional ILC2s. In particular, we shed light on the function of GATA3 in promoting the specific gene expression in ILC3-like skin ILCs and regulating their crucial roles in hair follicle recycling, which will improve our knowledge about the involvement of ILCs in maintaining homeostasis of skin.",

    "Summary": "Immune and tissue stem cells retain an epigenetic memory of inflammation that intensifies sensitivity to future encounters. Here, we address whether and to what consequence stem cells possess and accumulate memories of diverse experiences. Monitoring a choreographed response to wounds, we find that as hair follicle stem cells leave their niche, migrate to repair damaged epidermis and take up long-term foreign residence there, they accumulate long-lasting epigenetic memories of each experience, culminating in post-repair epigenetic adaptations that sustain the epidermal transcriptional program and surface barrier. Each memory has its own physiological impact, collectively endowing these stem cells with heightened regenerative ability to heal wounds and broadening their tissue regenerating tasks compared to their naïve counterparts. These findings have profound implications for tissue fitness and aging.",

    "Summary": "One of the keys to achieving skin regeneration lies within understanding the heterogeneity of neonatal fibroblasts, which support skin regeneration. However, the molecular underpinnings regulating the cellular states and fates of these cells are not fully understood. To investigate this, we performed a parallel multi-omics analysis by processing neonatal murine skin for single-cell ATAC-sequencing (scATAC-seq) and single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) separately. Our approach revealed that fibroblast clusters could be sorted into papillary and reticular lineages based on transcriptome profiling, as previously published. However, scATAC-seq analysis of neonatal fibroblast lineage markers, such as, Dpp4/CD26, Corin, and Dlk1 along with markers of myofibroblasts, revealed accessible chromatin in all fibroblast populations despite their lineage specific transcriptome profiles. These results suggests that accessible chromatin does not always translate to gene expression and that many fibroblast lineage markers reflect a fibroblast state, which includes neonatal papillary, reticular, and myofibroblasts. This analysis also provides a possible explanation as to why these marker genes can be promiscuously expressed in different fibroblast populations under different conditions. Our scATAC-seq analysis also revealed that the functional lineage restriction between dermal papilla and adipocytes fates are regulated by distinct chromatin landscapes. Finally, we have developed a webtool for our multi-omics analysis: https://skinregeneration.org/scatacseq-and-scrnaseq-data-from-thompson-et-al-2021-2/.",

    "Summary": "Both agonist studies and loss-of-function models indicate that PPARγ plays an important role in cutaneous biology. Since PPARγ has a high level of basal activity, we hypothesized that epidermal PPARγ would regulate normal homeostatic processes within the epidermis. In this current study, we performed mRNA sequencing and differential expression analysis of epidermal scrapings from knockout mice and wildtype littermates. Pparg-/-epi mice exhibited a 1.5-fold or greater change in the expression of 11.8% of 14,482 identified transcripts. Up-regulated transcripts included those for a large number of cytokines/chemokines and their receptors, as well as genes associated with inflammasome activation and keratinization. Several of the most dramatically up-regulated pro-inflammatory genes in Pparg-/-epi mouse skin included Igfl3, 2610528A11Rik, & Il1f6. RT-PCR was performed from RNA obtained from non-lesional full-thickness skin and verified a marked increase in these transcripts, as well as transcripts for Igflr1, which encodes the receptor for Igfl3, and the 2610528A11Rik receptor (Gpr15). Transcripts for Il4 were detected in Pparg-/-epi mouse skin, but transcripts for Il17 & Il22 were not detected. Down-regulated transcripts included sebaceous gland markers and a number of genes associated with lipid barrier formation. The change in these transcripts correlates with an asebia phenotype, increased transepidermal water loss, alopecia, dandruff and the appearance of spontaneous inflammatory skin lesions. Histologically, non-lesional skin showed hyperkeratosis, while inflammatory lesions were characterized by dermal inflammation and epidermal acanthosis, spongiosis, and parakeratosis. In conclusion, loss of epidermal Pparg alters a substantial set of genes that are associated with cutaneous inflammation, keratinization and sebaceous gland function. This data indicates that epidermal PPARγ plays an important role in homeostatic epidermal function, particularly epidermal differentiation, barrier function, sebaceous gland development and function, and inflammatory signaling.",

Previous reports showed that slow cycling label-retaining cells (LRCs) are present in two prominent hair follicle SC populations, basal and suprabasal bulge SCs (bBSCs, sbBSCs). CD34+/itga6low sbBSC and neighbouring CD34+/itga6high bBSCs seem similar with both SC populations able to self-renew in vitro and to generate new hair follicles when grafted. Until now, functional differences have not been reported and molecular mechanisms underlying a positional encoded, intrinsic bulge SC heterogeneity and the relations to SC plasticity and tissue function are not well understood. Following fluorescence activated cell sorting for CD34 and integrin alpha6 of keratinocytes from 7 weeks old mice, we provide sequencing data for two prominent hair follicle SC populations, bBSC and sbBSC, suggesting distinct and overlapping functions in skin homeostasis.",

    "Summary": "Hair follicle growth inhibitory effect of dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-treated two-dimensional (2D)- and 3D-cultured DPCs were evaluated. 2D- and 3D-cultured DPC proliferation was inhibited after co-culturing with outer root sheath (ORS) cells under DHT treatment. Moreover, gene expression levels of β‐catenin and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) were significantly decreased and those of cleaved caspase-3 significantly increased in 2D- and 3D-cultured DPCs with increasing DHT concentrations. ORS cell proliferation also significantly increased after co-culturing in the control-3D model compared with the control-2D model. ki67 downregulation and cleaved caspase-3 upregulation in DHT-2D and 3D groups significantly inhibited ORS cell proliferation. Sequencing showed an increase in the expression of genes related to extracellular matrix synthesis in the 3D model group. Additionally, the top 10 hub genes were identified, and the expression of nine chemokine-related genes in DHT-treated DPCs was found significantly increased. We also identified the interactions between transcription factor (TF)–genes and microRNAs with hub genes and the TF–microRNA coregulatory network. Overall, the findings indicate that 3D-cultured DPCs are more representative of in vivo conditions than are 2D-cultured DPCs, and contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying androgen-induced alopecia.",

    "Summary": "Injury in adult tissue generally reactivates developmental programs to foster regeneration, but it is not known whether this paradigm applies to growing tissue. Here, by employing blisters, we show that epidermal wounds heal at the expense of skin development. The regenerated epidermis suppresses the expression of tissue morphogenesis genes accompanied by delayed hair follicle (HF) growth. Lineage tracing experiments, cell proliferation dynamics, and mathematical modeling reveal that the progeny of HF junctional zone stem cells, which undergo a morphological transformation, repair the blisters while not promoting HF development. In contrast, the contribution of interfollicular stem cell progeny to blister healing is small. These findings demonstrate that tissue development can be sacrificed for the sake of wound regeneration and suggest that tissue repair does not coincide with the reactivation of developmental programs in all regenerative contexts. Our study elucidates the key cellular mechanism of wound healing in skin blistering diseases.",

    "Summary": "Wound healing is a multi-step process to rapidly restore barrier function. This process is often impaired in diabetic patients resulting in chronic wounds and amputation. We previously found that paradoxical activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway via topical administration of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib accelerates wound healing by activating keratinocyte proliferation and reepithelialization pathways in healthy mice. Herein, we investigated whether this wound healing acceleration also occurs in impaired diabetic wounds and found that topical vemurafenib not only improves wound healing in a murine diabetic wound model, but unexpectedly promotes hair follicle regeneration. Neogenic hair follicles expressing Sox-9, CD34 and K15 were found in wounds of diabetic and non-diabetic mice, and their formation can be prevented by blocking downstream MEK signaling. Thus, topically applied BRAF inhibitors may accelerate wound healing, and promote the restoration of improved skin architecture in both normal and impaired wounds.",

In addition, we identified N1-acetylspermidine as a novel parallel regulator of cell fate decisions. To identify the molecular mechanism by which N1-AcSpd supplementation promotes stemness, we performed RNA-sequencing. We unravel an increase in proliferation.

Using a photo-labelling technique and RamDA-seq as described in the overall design, we obtained accurate scRNA-seq data from developing hair follicles (HFs), reflecting the spatiotemporal dynamics of cellular state transition during HF morphogenesis. Single cell transcriptome analysis identified cell types, which cannot be distinguished by known makers, their signature markers, and transcriptional state changes in developing HFs. By integration of the data from single cell live imaging, our findings revealed the origin and developmental trajectories of tissue stem cells (SCs), leading to a new model of HF development and SC induction with unprecedented resolution.",

    "Summary": "Obesity, a worldwide epidemic, predisposes to many ageing-associated diseases, yet its exact impact on organ dysfunction is largely unknown. Hair follicles, mini-epithelial organs that grow hair, miniaturize by ageing to cause hair loss through the depletion of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Here, we report that obesity-induced stress such as by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding primarily targets HFSCs to accelerate hair thinning. Chronological gene expression analysis revealed that HFD feeding for four consecutive days directs activated HFSCs toward epidermal keratinization by generating excessive reactive oxygen species yet retains HFSC pools in young mice. Integrative analysis with stem cell fate tracing, epigenetic analysis and reverse genetics revealed that further feeding of HFD subsequently induces lipid droplets and NF-B activation within HFSCs via autocrine/paracrine IL1R signaling. Those integrated factors converge on the profound inhibition of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signal transduction in HFSCs, thereby further depleting lipid-laden HFSCs through their aberrant differentiation and inducing hair follicle miniaturization and eventual hair loss. Conversely, Shh activation by transgenes or compounds rescues HFD-induced hair loss. These data collectively demonstrate that stem cell inflammageing induced by obesity robustly represses organ regeneration signals to accelerate the mini-organ miniaturization, and suggests the importance of daily prevention of organ dysfunction.",

FACS purified CD34+/K14-H2BGFP+ single-cell suspension was processed for the barcoded single-cell 3′ cDNA libraries generation using Chromium Single Cell 3′ gel bead and library Kit v3. The final libraries were quantified using Agilent Bioanalyzer high sensitivity DNA chip and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq-500. The raw data files were demultiplexed to generate the sample-specific FASTQ files, which were aligned to the mouse reference genome (mm10-3.0.0) using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline (v3.1.0). The raw scRNA-seq data was processed using Cell Ranger from the 10x platform to generate an expression matrix that was further analyzed in R using the Seurat package version 3.1. Only high-quality cells that had between 200 and 5000 genes expressed and had under 10% of the UMIs mapped to mitochondrial genes were retained.

    "Summary": "Stem cells support the lifelong maintenance of adult organs but their specific roles during injury are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Lgr6 marks a regionally restricted population of epidermal stem cells that interact with nerves and specialize in wound re-epithelialization. Diphtheria toxin-mediated ablation of Lgr6 stem cells delays wound healing, and skin denervation phenocopies this effect. Using intravital imaging to capture stem cell dynamics after injury, we show that wound re-epithelialization by Lgr6 stem cells is diminished following the loss of nerves. This induces the recruitment of other stem cell populations, including hair follicle stem cells, which partially compensate to mediate the wound closure. Single-cell lineage tracing and gene expression analysis reveal that the fate of Lgr6 stem cells is shifted towards differentiation following the loss of their niche. We conclude that Lgr6 epidermal stem cells are primed for injury response and interact with nerves to regulate their fate",

    "Summary": "The development of complex stratified epithelial barriers in mammals is initiated from single-layered epithelia. How stratification is initiated and fueled are still open questions. Previous studies on skin epidermal stratification suggested a central role for perpendicular/asymmetric cell division orientation of the basal keratinocyte progenitors. Here, we use centrosomes, that organize the mitotic spindle, to test whether cell division orientation and stratification are linked. Genetically ablating centrosomes from the developing epidermis leads to the activation of the p53-, 53BP1- and USP28-dependent mitotic surveillance pathway causing a thinner epidermis and hair follicle arrest. The centrosome/p53-double mutant keratinocyte progenitors significantly alter their division orientation in the later stages without majorly affecting epidermal differentiation. Together with time-lapse imaging and tissue growth dynamics measurements, the data suggest that the first and major phase of epidermal development is boosted by high proliferation rates in both basal and suprabasally-committed keratinocytes as well as cell delamination, whereas the second phase maybe uncoupled from the division orientation of the basal progenitors. The data provide insights for tissue homeostasis and hyperproliferative diseases that may recapitulate developmental programs.",

    "Summary": "The epidermis consists of different compartments such as the hair follicle (HF), sebaceous gland (SG) and interfollicular epidermis (IFE), each containing distinct stem cell (SC) populations. However, with the exception of the SCs residing within the HF bulge, other epidermal SC populations remain poorly characterized at the molecular level. Here we used an epigenomic strategy that combines H3K27me3 ChIP-seq and RNA-seq profiling to identify major regulators of HFSC located outside the bulge. When applied to the bulk of HFSC isolated from mouse skin our approach identified both previously known and potentially novel non-bulge HFSC regulators. Among the latter, we found that PRDM16 was preferentially expressed within the Junctional Zone (JZ). To investigate PRDM16 function within the JZ SCs, we generated an epidermal-specific Prdm16 Knock-out mouse model (K14-Cre-Prdm16fl/fl). Notably, although these K14-Cre-Prdm16fl/fl mice did not show any major skin or hair abnormalities, the homeostasis of the SG was clearly compromised. Namely, PRDM16 deficient mice displayed enlarged SGs and excessive sebum production, thus resembling some of the features associated with certain human conditions (i.e. acne, sebaceous hyperplasia). Overall, our study provides a list of putative novel regulators of HFSC outside the bulge and identifies PRDM16 as a major regulator of SG homeostasis.",

We use the wound-induced hair neogenesis (WIHN) model to investigate the mechanical and molecular responses of the laboratory (Mus) and African spiny (Acomys) mice. Laboratory and spiny mice showed an opposite trend of spatiotemporal morphogenetic field for WIHN during wound healing, and wound stiffness gradient across the whole wound bed predicated pattern of hair formation. Using bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis and K14-Cre-Twist1 transgenic mice, we identified the central role of the Twist1 pathway as the mediator of epidermal-dermal interaction and the emergence of periodic hair primordia. Lastly, we generated a Turing model with an underlying measure of stiffness to support a two-scale tissue mechanic model to explain the setup of a morphogenetic field from a wound bed (mm scale) or periodically arranged hair primordia from a morphogenetic field (μm scale). Delineating the common and distinct chemo-mechanical events during regenerative wound healing between laboratory and African spiny mice reveal its evo-devo advantages, which provide new perspectives for regenerative medicine.",

    "Summary": "Chronic, sustained exposure to stressors can profoundly impact tissue homeostasis, although the mechanisms by which these changes occur are largely unknown. Here, we report the adrenal gland-derived stress hormone corticosterone (the rodent equivalent of cortisol) regulates hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) quiescence and hair growth in mice. Without systemic corticosterone, HFSCs enter substantially more rounds of the regeneration cycle throughout life. Conversely, under chronic stress, elevated corticosterone levels prolong HFSC quiescence and keep hair follicles in an extended resting phase. Mechanistically, corticosterone acts on dermal papilla (DP) to suppress the expression of a secreted factor, Growth Arrest Specific 6 (Gas6). Restoring Gas6 expression overcomes stress-induced inhibition of HFSC activation and hair growth. Our work identifies corticosterone as a systemic inhibitor of HFSC activity via its impact on the niche, and demonstrates that removal of such inhibition drives HFSCs into frequent regeneration cycles with no observable defects long-term.",

    "Summary": "Epithelial tissues possess a barrier function that must be restored following injury. Repair often involves changes in cell fate, but it remains poorly understood how cell plasticity is induced and whether responses vary with distinct types of damage. Here, we reveal that genotoxic agents, but not mechanical damage, induce hyperplasia and lineage infidelity in the interfollicular epidermis, as well as in two epidermal subappendages: the mammary gland and hair follicle. DNA damage to the epidermis promotes stromal proliferation, and induces basal cell hyperplasia with formation of abnormal, multi-layered K14+/K10+ cells. Unexpectedly, this behavior is epithelial cell non-autonomous, but independent of immunity. Instead, dermal fibroblasts are both necessary and sufficient to induce the epithelial response. We identify a previously unrecognized fibroblast-specific NLRP3 inflammasome that drives this response via IL-1β. Thus, genotoxic agents, used chemotherapeutically to promote cancer cell death, can have the opposite effect on wild-type epithelia, paradoxically promoting hyperplasia and inducing both stemness and lineage infidelity via a non-autonomous, fibroblast-driven mechanism.",

    "Summary": "Much is still unknown about the molecular regulatory networks which govern the dermal papilla’s (DP) ability to induce hair follicle regeneration, a capacity which gradually decreases with age. DP and dermal sheath cup (DSC) cells from mature, anagen phase, hair follicles were manually microdissected from fresh frozen sections of 16-18 week human fetal scalp and 30-60 year old adult male scalp. Interfollicular dermal (IFD) fibroblasts were harvested for comparison. RNA-seq libraries from each cell population were prepared with Nugen’s Ovation RNA-Seq and Ultralow Library systems, sequenced to approximately 100 million total reads. A set of 121 genes was identified as significantly upregulated in fetal DP cells, as compared to both fetal DSC and IFD populations. Wnt/β-catenin, Shh, FGF, BMP, and Notch signaling pathways were significantly enriched among those genes differentially expressed between fetal and adult DP cells. Among them, Spondin-1, a Wnt agonist, was chosen for verification and can rescue hair follicle regeneration in skin reconstitution assays using cells from adult mice. Additionally, twenty-nine transcription factors were significantly upregulated in fetal DP compared to adult DP cells.

The captured material was subjected to whole transcriptome RNA sequencing. With this strategy, we found that repigmentation in the bulge MCs precursors is driven by KCTD10, a signal with unknown roles in the skin, and by CTNNB1 (encoding β-catenin) and RHO-GTPase (RHO), two signaling pathways previously shown to be involved in pigmentation biology.",

    "Summary": "Vertebrate Hox genes are key players in the establishment of structures during the development of the main body axis. Subsequently, they play important roles either in organizing secondary axial structures such as the appendages, or during homeostasis in postnatal stages and adulthood. Here we set up to analyze their elusive function in the ectodermal compartment, using the mouse limb bud as a model. We report that the HoxC gene cluster was globally co-opted to be transcribed in the distal limb ectoderm, where it is activated following the rule of temporal colinearity. These ectodermal cells subsequently produce various keratinized organs such as nails or claws. Accordingly, deletion of the HoxC cluster led to mice lacking nails (anonychia) and also hairs (alopecia), a condition stronger than the previously reported loss of function of Hoxc13, which is causative of the ectodermal dysplasia 9 (ECTD9) syndrome in human patients. We further identified, in mammals only, two ectodermal-specific enhancers located upstream the gene cluster, which act synergistically to regulate Hoxc genes in these ectodermal organs. Deletion of these enhancers alone or in combination revealed a strong quantitative component in the regulation of these genes in the ectoderm, suggesting that these two enhancers may have evolved along with mammals to provide the level of HOXC proteins necessary for the full development of hairs and nails.",

    "Summary": "Alopecia areata (AA) is one of the most common autoimmune conditions, presenting initially with loss of hair without overt skin changes. The unremarkable appearance of the skin surface contrasts with the complex immune activity occurring at the hair follicle. AA pathogenesis is due to the loss of immune privilege of the hair follicle leading to autoimmune attack. Although the literature has focused on CD8+ T cells, vital roles for CD4+ T cells and antigen-presenting cells have been suggested. Here, we use single-cell sequencing to reveal distinct expression profiles of immune cells in AA. We found clonal expansions of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, with shared clonotypes across varied transcriptional states. These data were used to generate highly predictive models of human AA disease. Finally, single-cell sequencing of T cells in human AA recapitulated the clonotypic findings and the gene expression of the predictive models.",

Interestingly, however, in adult mice, large skin injuries exhibit de novo formation of hair follicles (HFs, a phenomenon termed wound-induced HF neogenesis) in the center of the wound. Our previous analysis provides compelling evidence suggesting that regional epigenetic changes within the mesenchymal cells of the skin may underlie the divergent response to wound healing. To test this directly, we performed single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using Sequencing (sc-ATAC-Seq) on cells isolated from the center of large wounds to identify regions of the genome that are becoming differentially accessible within upper (epithelial-interfacing) fibroblasts as they transition to induce new HFs compared to their lower dermal counterparts that adopt a fibrotic phenotype. Together, our data reveals the identity and dynamics of key coding, non-coding, and regulatory regions that underlie a wound responsive fibroblasts' transition to inductive neodermal condensate cells.",

    "Summary": "Adult mammalian skin wound healing is typically accompanied by fibrotic scar that impairs normal skin function and regeneration of skin appendages. Interestingly, however, in adult mice, large severe skin injuries exhibit de novo formation of HFs following severe skin injuries (a phenomenon termed wound-induced HF neogenesis, WIHN). Understanding the competent cell types and molecular mechanisms that enable regenerative wound healing will be critical for developing treatments that restore skin function after injury. We described the existence of an adult bipotent hair follicle dermal stem cell (hfDSC) that functions to regenerate the connective tissue sheath and to populate the DP with new cells (Rahmani et al., 2014). Based on this, we hypothesized that the mesenchymal cells comprised within the neogenic HFs might originate from hfDSCs. To test this, we employed αSMACreERT2:ROSAYFP and Hic1CreERT2:TDTmt mice to examine the contribution of hfDSCs or hfDSCs and reticular/hypodermal progenitors, respectively, to the formation of neodermis and regeneration of de novo HFs. Mice received full-thickness excision wounds (>1 cm2) and then harvested at 18-140 days post-wounding (dpw). αSMA+ve and Hic1-lineage cells were activated upon wounding, migrated into the wound, and contributed to both DP and DS in almost all de novo-formed HFs. Surprisingly, hfDSCs contributed only a minority of cells (20%) to nascent DP cells, whereas Hic1-lineage cells generated >90% of the neogenic DP cells. In both cases, cells integrating into neogenic HF mesenchyme appeared to restore the hfDSC pool, since they repopulated the neogenic mesenchyme over successive regenerative hair cycles. Finally, using an ex vivo HF formation assay, we found that prospectively isolated extrafollicular Hic-lineage cells could participate in HF formation when exposed to a permissive environment. Our data reveal that despite their origin in the reticular/hypodermis, Hic1-lineage dermal progenitors are able to adopt a regenerative response during wound healing if provided with a permissive local environment.",
    "Overall_Design": "To isolate cells comprising the wound neodermis, we created small (8 mm diameter) and large (1.5 cm diameter) full-thickness skin wounds on P.24-26 Hic1Cre:tdTomato+ve mice treated with tamoxifen as pups (P.4-5). We FACS collected viable Hic1tdTomato+ve cells 14 dpw from four separate cell populations in parallel. These included: 1) cells recruited in small (scar-forming) wounds, 2) cells recruited to outside (scar-forming portion) of large wound, 3) cells recruited to center (regenerative portion) of large wounds, and 4) cells within the intact (uninjured) skin. All four samples were processed according to 10X Genomics ChromiumTM Single Cell 3â Reagent Guidelines v2 Chemistry as per the manufacturerâs protocol. In brief, single cells were sorted into 0.1% BSAâPBS and partitioned into Gel Bead-In-EMulsions (GEMs) using 10xTM GemCodeTM Technology. This process lysed cells and enabled barcoded reverse transcription of RNA, generating full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA. DynaBeadsÂ® MyOneTM Silane magnetic beads were used to remove leftover biochemical reagents, then cDNA was amplified by PCR over 10 cycles. Quality control size gating was used to select cDNA amplicon size prior to library construction. Read 1 primer sequences were added to cDNA during GEM incubation. P5 primers, P7 primers, i7 sample index, and Read 2 primer sequences were added during library construction. Quality control and cDNA quantification was performed using Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. Sequencing was performed first using Illumina MiSeq SR50 to approximate the number of recovered cells in each sample. We recovered 4061, 3776, 2604, and 3293 cells for Samples 1-4, respectively, with an estimated doublet rate of â3%. Based on this, we determined lane distributions for sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 4000 PE (75 bp paired-end reads) with a targeted sequencing depth of ~115,000 reads/cell.",

    "Summary": "Piloerection (goosebump) requires concerted actions of the hair follicle, the arrector pili muscle (APM), and the sympathetic nerve, providing a model to study interactions across epithelium, mesenchyme, and nerves. Here, we show that APMs and sympathetic nerves form a dual component niche to modulate hair follicle stem cell (HFSC) activity. Sympathetic nerves form synapse-like structures with HFSCs and regulate HFSCs through norepinephrine, whereas APMs maintain sympathetic innervation to HFSCs. Without norepinephrine signaling, HFSCs enter a deep quiescence state by down-regulating cell cycle machinery and mitochondria metabolism, while up-regulating quiescence regulators Lhx2, Foxp1, and Fgf18. During development, HFSC progeny secrets Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) to direct the formation of this APM-sympathetic nerve niche, which in turn controls hair follicle regeneration in adults. Our results reveal a reciprocal interdependence between a regenerative tissue and its niche at different stages, and illustrate that nerves can modulate stem cell quiescence through synapses and neurotransmitters.",
    "Overall_Design": "The sympathetic nerves influence hair follicle stem cells through binding of norepinephrine to the adrenergic receptor beta 2 (Adrb2). Deletion of Adrb2 specifically from hair follicle stem cells using the K15-crePGR reporter allows us to uncover molecular changes downstream of adrenergic signaling.

    "Summary": "Advanced age drives the progressive degeneration of mammalian hair follicles (HF) and termination of its regeneration cycle. The role of hair follicle dermal stem cell (hfDSC) in this age-associated HF dysfunction remains largely unexplored. Here, we first characterize a novel function of hfDSCs in regenerating the full dermal papilla (DP) after laser ablation. Next, we performed long-term fate mapping, age-dependant in vivo clonal analysis and in vitro proliferation assay on hfDSCs to describe the age-related defects in mesenchymal stem cell self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing of the HF mesenchymal population mapped the intrinsic transcriptional changes that may drive their age-related dysfunction. We highlight the requirement of hfDSCs for normal HF regeneration. Our findings characterize a novel function of mesenchymal stem cells, and how this crucial cell becomes dysfunctional with age to drive age-related hair loss.",
    "Overall_Design": "We enriched for mesenchymal cells within the mammalian hair follicle for analysis. We first generated Î±-SMACreERT2:ROSAYFP transgenic mice, and treated the mice with tamoxifen at 3 and 4 days of age to permanently label the hair follicle dermal stem cells and their progeny. The mice were aged to either young (2mo and 12mo) aged (18mo) cohorts before isolation. To isolate cells of the hair follicle mesenchyme, we utilized Fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). We collected two populations of cells for all samples, to a total of 10,000 cells per age cohort (N=2 per cohort). First, we collected 5000 cells that were YFP+ and (Itga9+ or Cd200+), then we collected 5000 cells that were Cd26+ and (Itga9+ or Cd200+). The two populations were mixed to generate two replicates of young (2mo), one replicate of 12mo and one replicate for 18mo. Samples were processed according to 10X Genomics ChromiumTM Single Cell 3â Reagent Guidelines v2 or v3 Chemistry as per the manufacturerâs protocol.

SCs reside in specialized microenvironments (niches) whose complexities and roles in orchestrating tissue growth are still unfolding. Here, we identify lymphatic capillaries as critical SC niche components. In skin, lymphatics form intimate networks around the SCs of each hair follicle (HF) during their non-regenerative phase, and remodel upon regeneration. Seeking understanding, we unravel a secretome switch within SCs that controls lymphatic behavior. Resting SCs express Angiopoietin-like 7 (Angptl7), promoting lymphatic drainage. Upon activation, SCs trigger an anti-lympho-angiogenic program, transiently sparking lymphatic dilation and dampened drainage. In mammals, this dynamic aria between SCs and lymphatics is essential for coordinating HFSC behavior and hair regeneration: Upon either depleting lymphatics, silencing Angptl7 or super-activating anti-lympho-angiogenesis, SCs precociously proliferate and HF regeneration becomes asynchronous. In unearthing lymphatic capillaries as a hitherto under-appreciated SC-niche element, we’ve learned how SCs coordinate their activity across a tissue.",

In the hair cycle during follicle regression, the niche traverses the skin through an unknown mechanism to reach the stem cells and prime regeneration. Here, by cell specific ablation and intravital imaging in live mice, we identify the follicle-lining dermal sheath as the key driver of tissue regression and niche relocation via smooth muscle contractile machinery that generates centripetal constriction force. We reveal the calcium/calmodulin/myosin light chain kinase pathway as the mechanism of sheath contraction that when blocked inhibits follicle contraction and impedes regression and niche relocation. Thus, our study identifies the dermal sheath as a smooth muscle that drives regression for reuniting niche and stem cells to regenerate tissue structure during homeostasis.",

    "Summary": "Organismal aging in mammals is manifested with architectural alteration and functional decline of multiple organs throughout the body. In aged skin, hairs are sparse, which has led to the hypothesis that the hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) undergo epidermal differentiation during aging. Here, we employ single cell analysis to interrogate aging-related changes in the HFSCs. Unexpectedly, HFSCs maintain their lineage fidelity and show no signs of shifting to an epidermal fate. Despite maintaining lineage identity, HFSCs do show prevalent transcriptional changes in extracellular matrix genes. Of importance, these HFSC changes are accompanied by profound architectural perturbations in the aging stem cell niche. Upon surveying the dermis from young and aged skin, we also observe age-related changes in many non-epithelial cell types, including resident immune cells, sensory neurons, arrector pili muscles, and blood vessels – all of which have been previously associated with abilities to modulate hair follicle regeneration. Consistent with both intrinsic and extrinsic alterations in stem cell: niche communications, we find that in response to skin wounding, aged HFSCs repair the epidermis, but are defective in hair follicle regeneration. Intriguingly, whereas aged dermis cannot support young HFSCs, aged HFSCs can be rescued when supported by young dermis. Together, these findings favor a model where skin tissue microenvironment plays a dominant role in dictating the molecular properties and activities of HFSCs.",

The lack of mechanistic details underlying these adverse events hampers their effective management. Here we identified EGFR as the epidermal master-regulator of the ERK pathway, which secures skin barrier integrity upon hair eruption. EGFR deficient epidermis displays a Th2-dominated expression signature and is permissive for excessive microbiota outgrowth. In the absence of EGFR, opening of the follicular ostia during hair eruption allows invasion of commensal microbiota aggravating barrier disruption and initiating an additional Th1 and Th17 response. Chronic folliculitis leads to Staphylococcus aureus dominated dysbiosis, further exacerbating inflammation and expanding barrier defects. Restoration of epidermal ERK signaling via therapeutic FGF7 treatment or transgenic SOS expression rescues skin barrier integrity in the absence of EGFR. These data reveal a gatekeeper function of the EGFR/ERK cascade in hair follicles securing the epidermal barrier around the erupting hair shaft.",

Here, we describe the inflammation-independent effects of EGFR-deficiency during skin morphogenesis and in adult HFSCs. Expression and alternative splicing analysis of RNAseq data from interfollicular epidermis and outer root sheath indicate that EGFR controls genes involved in epidermal differentiation, but also in centrosome function, DNA damage, cell cycle and apoptosis. Genetic experiments employing p53-deletion in EGFR–deficient epidermis reveal that EGFR signalling exhibits p53-dependent functions in proliferative epidermal compartments, as well as p53–independent functions in differentiated hair shaft keratinocytes. Loss of EGFR leads to absence of Lef1 protein specifically in the innermost epithelial hair layers, resulting in disorganization of medulla cells. Thus, our results uncover important spatial and temporal features of cell-autonomous EGFR functions in the epidermis.",

Little is known about how adult stem cells respond to irreversible DNA damage, resulting in loss of regeneration in humans. Here, we establish a permanent regeneration loss model using cycling human hair follicles treated with alkylating agents: busulfan followed by cyclophosphamide. We unravel the underlying mechanisms by which hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) lose their pool. Contrary to immediate destructive changes in rapidly proliferating hair matrix cells, quiescent HFSCs show unexpected massive proliferation after busulfan and then undergo large-scale apoptosis following cyclophosphamide. HFSC proliferation is activated through PI3K/Akt pathway, and depletion is driven by p53/p38-induced cell death. RNA-seq analysis shows that HFSCs experience mitotic catastrophe with G2/M checkpoint activation. Our findings indicate that priming mobilization causes stem cells to lose their resistance to DNA damage, resulting in permanent loss of regeneration after alkylating chemotherapy.",

    "Summary": "Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs) are evolutionary-conserved multiprotein complexes that maintain transcriptional repression during development and differentiation to establish and preserve cell identity. Through the enzymatic activity of the subunits Ring1A and Ring1B, PRC1 monoubiquitinates histone H2A on lysine 119, promoting nucleosome compaction. We recently described a fundamental role of PRC1 in preserving intestinal stem cells identity through the inhibition of non-lineage specific transcription factors. To gain more insight into the role of PRC1 in adult stem cell maintenance, we have now investigated its role in LGR5+ hair follicle stem cells during physiological regeneration. We show that PRC1 depletion in LGR5+ cells severely affects hair regeneration. Differently from what we described for ISCs, the release of target transcriptional repression upon loss of PRC1 activity induces the ectopic activation of an epidermal-specific program. Our data support a general role of PRC1 in preserving cell identity that is shared between different stem cell compartments. However, we propose that the final outcome of the ectopic activation of non-lineage specific transcription factors observed upon loss of PRC1 in stem cells is largely context-dependent and likely related to the transcription factors repertoire and the specific epigenetic landscape of the different cellular compartments.",

Interestingly, these changes appear to be rarely associated with transcriptional alterations of protein-coding genes but are linked to heterochromatin stabilization and RTE silencing. Que treatment prevented L1 from hyperactivation, thereby inhibiting SASP.",

Gene expression profiling was performed on scalp biopsies of alopecia areata patients taken at baseline and up to 24 weeks of treatment of tofacitinib. We applied both naïve and supervised clustering to this dataset in order to assess two features: the overall molecular effect of tofacitinib treatment on patient samples, and the concordant molecular response of the disease. The former was assessed by an unbiased, unsupervised differential expression analysis and the latter was measured by response to previously published gene expression signatures defining AA pathology. To ensure parity of the data, for this analysis we only included patient samples that had matched pre-treatment, Tx-00, and 24 weeks of treatment, Tx-24, samples. Gene expression profiles and Alopecia Areata Disease Activity Index (ALADIN) scores correlated with clinical response.",

    "Summary": "Background: Previous studies demonstrated that adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) can promote hair growth, but unmet needs exist for enhancing ASC hair inductivity. Objective: Therefore, we introduced three trichogenic factors platelet-derived growth factor-A, SOX2, and β-catenin to ASCs (tfASCs) and evaluated whether tfASCs have similar characteristics as dermal papilla (DP) cells. Method: Global gene expression was examined using NGS analysis. Telogen-to-anagen induction, vibrissae hair follicle organ culture and patch assay were used. Results: tfASC cell size is smaller than that of ASCs, and they exhibit short doubling time. tfASCs also resist aging and can be expanded until passage 12. Cell proportion in S and G2/M increases in tfASCs, and tfASCs express high mRNA levels of cell cycle related genes. The mRNA expression of DP markers was notably higher in tfASCs. Moreover, NGS analysis revealed that the global gene expression of tfASCs is similar to that of DP cells. The injection of tfASCs accelerated the telogen-to-anagen transition and conditioned medium of tfASCs increased the anagen phase of vibrissal hair follicles. Finally, we found that the injection of 3D-cultured tfASCs at p 9 generated new hair follicles in nude mice. Conclusion: Collectively, these results indicate that 1) tfASCs have similar characteristics as DP cells, 2) tfASCs have enhanced hair-regenerative potential compared with ASCs, and 3) tfASCs even at late passage can make new hair follicles in a hair reconstitution assay. Because DP cells are difficult to isolate/expand and ASCs have low hair inductivity, tfASCs and tfASC-CM are clinically good candidates for hair regeneration.",

    "Summary": "The microRNA-200 family is highly expressed in epithelial cells and frequently lost in metastatic cancer. Although the tumor-suppressing roles of this family are well documented and directly linked to the inhibition of mesenchymal genes, their targets and functions in normal epithelial tissues remain unclear. Furthermore, how the two sub-families of the five-microRNA family distinguished by a single nucleotide within the seed region regulate their targets is unclear. Here we show that the microRNA-200 family governs hair morphogenesis and fine-tunes stem cell specification by regulating cell adhesion, polarity and signaling pathways. By directly ligating microRNAs to their targeted mRNA regions, we identify numerous targets involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, cell cycle and Hippo/Yap signaling in a miRNA:mRNA pair-specific manner. The two sub-families bind to largely distinct target sites although many genes are regulated by both sub-families for a greater degree of regulation. Using inducible and knockout mouse models, we show that the microRNA-200 family enhances cell adhesion, inhibits migration and reduces cell division, contributing to precise stem cell specification. Our findings demonstrate that combinatorial targeting of many genes is critical for microRNA functions and provide new insights into microRNA-200s’ functions in normal epithelial tissues.",

    "Summary": "Tissue regeneration relies on resident stem cells (SCs), whose activity and lineage choices are influenced by microenvironment. Exploiting the synchronized, cyclical bouts of tissue regeneration in hair follicles (HFs), we investigate how microenvironment dynamics shape the emergence of SC lineages. Employing epigenetic and ChIP-seq profiling, we uncover how signal-dependent transcription factors couple spatio-temporal cues to chromatin dynamics, thereby choreographing SC lineages. Using enhancer-driven reporters, mutagenesis and genetics, we show that simultaneous BMP-inhibitory and WNT signals set the stage for lineage choices by establishing chromatin platforms permissive for diversification. Mechanistically, when binding of BMP-effector pSMAD1 is relieved, super-enhancers driving HF-SC master regulators become silenced. Concomitantly, multipotent, lineage-fated super-enhancers silent in HF-SCs become activated by exchanging WNT-effectors TCF3/4 for LEF1. Throughout regeneration, lineage super-enhancers continue reliance upon LEF1, but then achieve specificity by accommodating additional incoming signaling effectors. Barriers to progenitor plasticity mount as diverse, signal-sensitive transcription factors shape LEF1-regulated super-enhancer dynamics.",

    "Summary": "Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage-tracing, temporal single cell analyses and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged uni-lineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: Some progenitors specify lineages immediately; others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.",

    "Summary": "Adult tissue stem cells (SCs) reside in niches, which through intercellular contacts and signaling, influence SC behavior. Once activated, SCs typically give rise to short-lived transit-amplifying cells (TACs), which then progress to differentiate into their lineages. Here, using single cell RNA-sequencing, we unearth unexpected heterogeneity among SCs and TACs of hair follicles. We trace the roots of this heterogeneity to micro-niches along epithelial-mesenchymal interfaces, where progenitors display molecular signatures reflective of spatially distinct local signals and intercellular interactions. Using lineage-tracing, temporal single cell analyses and chromatin landscaping, we show that SC plasticity becomes restricted in a sequentially and spatially choreographed program, culminating in seven spatially arranged uni-lineage progenitors within TACs of mature follicles. By compartmentalizing SCs into micro-niches, tissues gain precise control over morphogenesis and regeneration: Some progenitors specify lineages immediately; others retain potency, preserving self-renewing features established early while progressively restricting lineages as they experience dynamic changes in microenvironment.",

    "Summary": "Tissue stem cells govern tissue regeneration and wound-repair. Tumors often hijack these normal cellular programs and exploit them for malignancy. Here, we identify such a phenomenon in skin, where stem cells of the epidermis and hair follicle remain faithfully restricted to fueling their own tissue during homeostasis. They lose lineage fidelity during tumorigenesis. Moreover, breakdown of stem cell lineage confinement – granting privileges associated with both fates – is not only a hallmark, but also obligatory for malignancy. Intriguingly, we find that lineage plasticity is also critical in wound-repair, where it functions transiently to redirect fates. Probing mechanism, we show that irrespective of cellular origin, lineage infidelity occurs in wounding when stress-responsive enhancers are activated and override the normal enhancers that govern lineage-specificity. In cancer, stress-responsive transcription factor levels rise, causing lineage commanders to reach excess. When lineage and stress factors collaborate, they activate new oncogenic enhancers that distinguish cancers from wounds.",
    "Overall_Design": "Open chromatin regions bound by TFs typically exhibit higher accessibility than otherwise closed regions. Since ATAC-seq technology can be applied on small numbers of SCs, we could use this approach to delineate open chromatin states across homeostatic, wound-induced and tumorigenic SC populations in vivo. Importantly, by complementing these data with transcriptional profiling, we could predict the TF binding sites that are functional for each cellular state",

    "Summary": "Chemotherapy often causes adverse effects including hair loss, however, the molecular basis remains unclear. A common assumption is that by targeting actively dividing cancer cells, chemo-drugs would inevitably damage normal proliferating cells as a “side effect”. Using both mouse hair and avian feather as models, here we show that down-regulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is a critical event mediating chemo-drug induced tissue damage. Reduced expression of Shh is also apparent in human patients who experience hair loss after receiving chemotherapy, and in animal models treated with several frontline chemo-drugs. Supplementation of Shh protein or steroid hormones that activate Shh signaling prevented hair loss, but interestingly, not the damage to the pigment system. Together, our results have elucidated a molecular mechanism underlying chemotherapy-induced tissue damage, and suggested novel concepts and methodologies for future clinical interventions and drug development.",

The reason why some tumors undergo EMT and other not might reflect intrinsic properties of their cell of origin, although this possibility is largely unexplored. By targeting the same oncogenic mutations to discrete skin compartments, we show cell type-specific chromatin and transcriptional states differentially prime tumors to EMT.  Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) derived from intrafollicular epidermis (IFE) are generally well-differentiated, while hair follicle (HF) stem cell-derived SCCs frequently exhibit EMT, efficiently form secondary tumors, and possess increased metastatic potential.  Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling revealed IFE and HF tumor-initiating cells possess distinct chromatin landscapes and gene regulatory networks associated with tumorigenesis and EMT that correlate with accessibility of key epithelial and EMT transcription factor binding sites.  These findings highlight the importance of chromatin states and transcriptional priming in dictating tumor phenotypes and EMT. ",

    "Summary": "The skin is a squamous epithelium that is continuously renewed by a population of basal layer stem/progenitor cells and can heal wounds. Here, we show that the transcription regulators YAP and TAZ localise to the nucleus in the basal layer of skin and are elevated upon wound healing. Skin-specific deletion of both YAP and TAZ in adult mice slows proliferation of basal layer cells, leads to hair loss and impairs regeneration after wounding. Contact with the basal extracellular matrix and consequent integrin-Src signalling is a key determinant of the nuclear localisation of YAP/TAZ in basal layer cells and in skin tumours. Contact with the basement membrane is lost in differentiating daughter cells, where YAP and TAZ become mostly cytoplasmic. In other types of squamous epithelia and squamous cell carcinomas, a similar control mechanism is present. By contrast, columnar epithelia differentiate an apical domain that recruits CRB3, Merlin (also known as NF2), KIBRA (also known as WWC1) and SAV1 to induce Hippo signalling and retain YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm despite contact with the basal layer extracellular matrix. When columnar epithelial tumours lose their apical domain and become invasive, YAP/TAZ becomes nuclear and tumour growth becomes sensitive to the Src inhibitor Dasatinib.",

Dermal papilla (DP) cells are required for activating SCs during the adult hair cycle, but the signal exchange between niche and SC precursors/transit amplifying progenitor cells (TACs) that regulates HF morphogenetic growth is largely unknown. Here we use six transgenic reporters to isolate 14 major skin and HF cell populations. With next-generation RNA sequencing we characterize their transcriptomes and define unique molecular signatures. SC precursors, TACs and the DP niche express a plethora of known and novel ligands and receptors. Signaling interaction network analysis reveals a birds-eye view of pathways implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. Using a systematic tissue-wide approach this work provides a comprehensive platform, linked to an interactive online database, to identify and further explore the SC/TAC/niche crosstalk regulating HF growth.",

Molecular mechanisms that constitutively maintain stem cell identity or promote stem cell proliferation and differentiation upon activation have been extensively studied.

Here we show mouse hair follicle stem cell compartment induces a transcription factor, Foxc1, when activated. Importantly, deletion of Foxc1 in the activated but not quiescent stem cells compromises stem cell identity, fails to re-establish quiescence and subsequently drives premature stem cell activation.These findings uncover a dynamic, cell-intrinsic mechanism employed by hair follicle stem cells to reinforce stemness in response to activation.",

    "Summary": "Differentiating pluripotent cells from fibroblast progenitors is a potentially transformative tool in personalized medicine. We previously identified relatively greater success culturing dura-derived fibroblasts than scalp-derived fibroblasts from postmortem tissue. We hypothesized that these differences in culture success were related to epigenetic differences between the cultured fibroblasts by sampling location, and therefore generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data on 11 intrinsically matched pairs of dural and scalp fibroblasts from donors across the lifespan (infant to 85 years). While these cultured fibroblasts were several generations removed from the primary tissue and morphologically indistinguishable, we found widespread epigenetic differences by sampling location at the single CpG (N=101,989), region (N=697), “block” (N=243), and global spatial scales suggesting a strong epigenetic memory of original fibroblast location. Furthermore, many of these epigenetic differences manifested in the transcriptome, particularly at the region-level. We further identified 7,265 CpGs and 11 regions showing significant epigenetic memory related to the age of the donor, as well as an overall increased epigenetic variability, preferentially in scalp-derived fibroblasts -83% of loci were more variable in scalp, hypothesized to result from cumulative exposure to environmental stimuli in the primary tissue. By integrating publicly available DNA methylation datasets on individual cell populations in blood and brain, we identified significantly increased inter-individual variability in our scalp- and other skin-derived fibroblasts on a similar scale as epigenetic differences between different lineages of blood cells. Lastly, these epigenetic differences did not appear to be driven by somatic mutation - while we identified 64 probable de-novo variants across the 11 subjects, there was no association between mutation burden and age of the donor (p=0.71). These results depict a strong component of epigenetic memory in cell culture from primary tissue, even after several generations of daughter cells, related to cell state and donor age.",

After data processing, normalization, and quality control with the minfi package, we obtained normalized data on 21 samples (one dura sample with lower quality was removed prior to across-sample normalization). The tissue donor demographics are tabulated in S1 Table in the publication.

    "Summary": "Differentiating pluripotent cells from fibroblast progenitors is a potentially transformative tool in personalized medicine. We previously identified relatively greater success culturing dura-derived fibroblasts than scalp-derived fibroblasts from postmortem tissue. We hypothesized that these differences in culture success were related to epigenetic differences between the cultured fibroblasts by sampling location, and therefore generated genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptome data on 11 intrinsically matched pairs of dural and scalp fibroblasts from donors across the lifespan (infant to 85 years). While these cultured fibroblasts were several generations removed from the primary tissue and morphologically indistinguishable, we found widespread epigenetic differences by sampling location at the single CpG (N=101,989), region (N=697), “block” (N=243), and global spatial scales suggesting a strong epigenetic memory of original fibroblast location. Furthermore, many of these epigenetic differences manifested in the transcriptome, particularly at the region-level. We further identified 7,265 CpGs and 11 regions showing significant epigenetic memory related to the age of the donor, as well as an overall increased epigenetic variability, preferentially in scalp-derived fibroblasts -83% of loci were more variable in scalp, hypothesized to result from cumulative exposure to environmental stimuli in the primary tissue. By integrating publicly available DNA methylation datasets on individual cell populations in blood and brain, we identified significantly increased inter-individual variability in our scalp- and other skin-derived fibroblasts on a similar scale as epigenetic differences between different lineages of blood cells. Lastly, these epigenetic differences did not appear to be driven by somatic mutation - while we identified 64 probable de-novo variants across the 11 subjects, there was no association between mutation burden and age of the donor (p=0.71). These results depict a strong component of epigenetic memory in cell culture from primary tissue, even after several generations of daughter cells, related to cell state and donor age.",
    "Overall_Design": "We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on scalp- and dura-derived cultured fibroblasts derived from 11 postmortem donors (22 samples) from across the lifespan, ranging from early infancy to 85 years. We removed one dura sample (2533.Dura) prior to aligning the reads to the genome, because it did not pass quality control in the first stage of our experiment (the DNA methylation data from that sample was lower in quality compared to the other samples). Data from this sample (2533.Dura) is not included in the processed data files deposited to GEO, but fastq files from that sample are available on SRA. The tissue donor demographics are tabulated in S1 Table in the publication. Briefly, 1 donor was female, the rest were male. 1 donor was African American, 1 was Hispanic, and the others were all Caucasian. 2 donors were diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, the diagnosis was unknown for 5 of the donors, and the remaining 4 donors were Controls.",

    "Summary": "Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells has been associated with metastasis, stemness and resistance to therapy. The reason why some tumors undergo EMT and other not might reflect intrinsic properties of their cell of origin, although this possibility is largely unexplored. By targeting the same oncogenic mutations to discrete skin compartments, we show cell type-specific chromatin and transcriptional states differentially prime tumors to EMT. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) derived from intrafollicular epidermis (IFE) are generally well-differentiated, while hair follicle (HF) stem cell-derived SCCs frequently exhibit EMT, efficiently form secondary tumors, and possess increased metastatic potential. Transcriptional and epigenomic profiling revealed IFE and HF tumor-initiating cells possess distinct chromatin landscapes and gene regulatory networks associated with tumorigenesis and EMT that correlate with accessibility of key epithelial and EMT transcription factor binding sites. These findings highlight the importance of chromatin states and transcriptional priming in dictating tumor phenotypes and EMT.",

    "Summary": "Cutaneous C-unmyelinated free nerve endings and hair follicles-innervating C-LTMRs convey two opposite aspects of touch sensation: a sensation of pain and a sensation of pleasant touch. The molecular mechanisms underlying these diametrically opposite functions are unknown. Here we used a mouse model that genetically marks C-LTMRs and the free nerve endings MRGPRD+ neurons in combination with fluorescent cell surface labeling, flow cytometry and RNA deep-sequencing technology. Cluster analysis of the RNA-Seq profiles of the purified neuronal subsets revealed 156 and 184 genes differentially expressed in MRGPRD-expressing neurons and C-LTMRs, respectively. 48 MRGPD- and 67 C-LTMRs-enriched genes were validated using a triple staining experiment approach and the Cav3.3 channel, found to be exclusively expressed in C-LTMRs, was validated using electrophysiology. Furthermore, our study greatly expands the molecular characterization of C-LTMRs and suggests that this particular population of neurons shares common transcriptional signatures with A and A low threshold mechanoreceptors.",
